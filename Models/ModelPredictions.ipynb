seven patients who had undergone surgical resection and one hundred and fifty six patients with whole brain radiation therapy as an initial treatment for their pbm from breast cancer in our institution and compared the difference of incidence of lmc according to clinical factors the diagnosis of lmc was made by cerebrospinal fluid cytology and or magnetic resonance imaging resultsa total of twenty seven patients in the study population developed lmc at median of six zero months ten of twenty seven patients developed lmc after sr whereas seventeen of one hundred and fifty six patients who received wbrt were diagnosed with lmc after the index procedure the incidence of lmc was significantly higher in the sr group compared with the wbrt group and the hazard ratio was two ninety five three additional factors were identified in the multivariable analysis the younger age group the progressing systemic disease showed significantly increased incidence of lmc whereas the adjuvant chemotherapy reduce the incidence conclusionthere is an increased risk of lmc after sr for pbm from breast cancer compared with wbrt the young age and systemic burden of cancer in terms of progressing systemic disease without adjuvant chemotherapy could be additional risk factors for the development of lmc\",\n          \"introduction pleomorphic adenoma also known as mixed tumor is the most common
