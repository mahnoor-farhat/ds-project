            "The best, most common method for determining risk factors for brain infarction and sudden cardiac death is based on a novel, risk model that identifies factors that are important for survival in the event of a significant injury or shock.\n",

            "They followed 40,000 adults between the ages of thirty–45 and found that a moderate amount of physical inactivity was associated with better cardiovascular health than usual daily physical activity among middle aged men and a reduced risk for many common diseases and cancer.\n",

            "All things being equal, higher electric charges facilitate more rapid chemical reactions; therefore higher electric fields can significantly enhance chemical reactions in most cases, despite its inherent disadvantages.\n",
            "If more and stronger electrons are available, electrons can be moved in particular directions without moving electrons through a magnetic field.\n",
            "The same can happen to larger charged areas, since larger charges carry stronger magnetic fields, and so can move away from those areas if they aren't being attracted to those area.\n",
            "So how many times have you seen something or an electron go \"up\" instead of \"down\"?\n",
            "These observations tend to suggest that, by being very concentrated there are generally weaker interactions of electrons, a result in which the electrons move closer together at a faster rate than they do in very dense areas, and with better energetic efficiency.\n",
            "But in that case you could conceivably use higher voltage to charge the reaction to provide more energetic efficiency, and thus an increase in the rate of reaction.\n",
            "That could work, but a few thousand times to build energy or chemical reactions just wouldn't have been worth it in a practical setting.\n",
            "The important question to answer, if your electric field determines how fast charges can move and what areas are affected by electrical charges is, \"What happens to charged plasma when the field is reduced in a linear fashion, e.g.\n",
            "when the magnetic field is removed?\".\n",

            "First, if electric currents are applied to charge clusters, then higher potential energy and an increase in the voltage of the clusters will reduce the electric field, as it did for large-scale molecular events.\n",
            "But that doesn't mean the electric field can disappear completely.\n",
            "Instead, it can be modified along the charge direction itself, with an increasing number of points near the top and bottom of the cells.\n",
