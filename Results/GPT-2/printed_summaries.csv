1,GPT-2 Summary,"This study offers a potential new approach for treatment of type 2 diabetes that reduces both progression of disease and adverse patient responses with a stable, low-cost regimen of beta cells; is likely to result in substantial advances for researchers looking to study the safety and efficacy of beta cell replacement therapy; and has several important prerequisites to qualify as a study.
I will discuss the major findings and discuss a few potential ways in which this study may go about getting this Phase III study off of the ground.
TL;DR: In the future, it appears that beta cells replaced allogeneic blood cells in patients with type 2 diabetes could lead to an increase in remission levels.
This study aims to find out what it takes to achieve this result – this study will help determine if this approach will deliver a significant breakthrough for patients.
To do this study, we need to assess the safety of beta cells; the need for ongoing studies and follow-up; and, also, whether the trial should go ahead and determine the clinical trial participants have been previously exposed to beta cells or not; any potential concerns associated with the trial, and how this study may impact them and others who may ultimately enroll in the trial.
TL;DR: The current study will allow researchers to find out if beta cells can be used for the first time in patients with type 2 diabetes without adding to the risk to patients.
TL;DR2: Although I have included all the required components of a large population trial, this study will focus on determining the feasibility in conducting one in human patients.
This is an important research question for me and many other investigators pursuing this approach of using beta cells for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
The trial design described here will give researchers a foundation"

2,GPT-2 Summary,"A quick summary of the biological and toxicological observations with and without ros cytokines in pancreatic cancer, and a discussion of each one.
Gastrointestinal Toxicity To date two of the most frequently reported clinical complications of pancreatic cancer are nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
Although patients with the first two of these complaints may benefit from conventional chemotherapy or radiation, the latter two are associated with cancer recurrence.
The other three most commonly reported complications occur with esophageal carcinoma.
In the first two categories, patients experience diarrhea, nausea, or a persistent nausea, and may require surgical excision and an intestinal biopsy (or both depending on the disease).
If surgical excision is not done to resolve the problem, chemotherapy may also result.
However, given the high incidence of esophageal cancer, these patients should be treated with appropriate dietary and therapeutic guidelines.
The most common of these is diet, which is based on fiber (the macronutrient found in wheat and some legumes).
The second most common is surgical excision and biopsy (to remove the esophagus), as discussed in a previous article on this page.
Other Pathogens (Toxic Toxicity) Toxins often occur in their earliest stages in the intestine.
These include viruses, bacteria, and other pathogens.
The presence of these invaders, often termed ""microorganisms,"" has two major outcomes: the host's ability to fight these pathogens, or inability to destroy these invaders entirely.
Antiviral therapies can provide a small percentage of the time these invaders are destroyed, and may require frequent rechallenge after"

4,GPT-2 Summary,"1.
For biocontrol by selective targeting of cell biology specific cells in combination with biocontrol methods can support the development of an array of biological chemotherapeutic agents using biological cell based screens that can be tailored to select for individual cell types in vitro, or in the clinical setting the use of biological screens for therapeutic specificity allows selection of molecules that target selected cell types in a controlled clinical setting using cells or tissues in living or induced animals, but the use of a biological cell based screening platform for clinical use is not currently widely practiced.
It is possible to use a cell based screening platform to facilitate selection of specific chemotherapeutic agents from compounds that have biologic activity, but this has been not well researched.
2.
It has been suggested that an array of biocontrol screens may lead to the development of a biological chemotherapeutic agent that uses a biological cell based screening platform capable of screening for multiple cell types and that provides biologic activity with the potential to be available in different dosage levels.
However a number of different screens are currently available that can be combined with each other to enable the screening with combinations of cell size, gene expression in tissue or cell types, or both using biological cell based screens.
The potential commercial application of screening is explored in further detail in 2.
However prior to demonstrating that multiple cell types can be selected or targeted for biologic activity using a biological cell based screen I will suggest that different screening technologies for cell types that are commonly used in biological screening will be examined before any more specific targets can be identified or identified using biological cells.
A list is available for those interested in such a system.
3.
The use of biocontrol can be further developed by using bioactivation using activated cell line, this can be achieved in animals or in the development of biological agents through the introduction or cultivation of a bi"

5,GPT-2 Summary,"Neurotransmitter signalling is influenced by temperature by a few key factors.
1.
Temperature controls the electrical excitability of cell membranes and also regulates the temperature-sensitive protein hypophosphatamylation and consequently the level of synaptic activation at synapses.
In addition, brain temperature influences many variables that are relevant for various disease processes, including:
2.
Temperature is highly related to a number of proteins (including heat shock protein A, heat shock protein B, and heat shock protein C).
3.
Different regions of the brain regulate the activity of various proteins such as heat shock protein A and its connexin subunits, and heat shock protein B and its subunit 1A.
4.
Several experimental techniques are used to investigate the impact of temperature on disease processes.
TL;DR – there is some evidence to suggest brain temperature influences disease processes.
There is quite a bit of data from the literature on which to draw conclusions.
Carcinogenesis
TL;DR – there appears to be a genetic component in heat shock protein C in humans.
However, human genes for heat shock protein C may or may not have been affected because their presence or absence was unknown when the mouse with a mutated genes was raised in the light-dark cycle experiments.
To date, it is unclear how Heat Shock protein C may be passed to non-human primates.
TL;DR – there is not much known about the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of heat shock pathology.
Alzheimer's Disease:
TLCL;DR – there is reasonable evidence that the heat shock protein C may be involved in the onset of Alzheimer's disease.
However, there is no data to show how this process could be reversed.

7,GPT-2 Summary,"
Pigmented, bioluminescent cells exist not uncommonly in human females, but are relatively rare because of the poor photomicrography.
While the most significant characteristic of Pigmented Female Carcinoma with Penis or Calf Mascara is the large glandular structure in front of the penis, it is difficult to assess its morphology and distribution in adult human females.
Pigmented, bioluminescent cells do exist in female genitals.
They are rare, usually only within the labia minora and vagina, and appear during copulation and before the onset of labor, when the vaginal opening is larger and thus does not receive an equal opportunity to grow.
The presence of Pigmented Female Carcinoma with Penis or Calf Mascara does not indicate that the vagina is infertile or a sterile environment.
In this review the objective was to explore the molecular mechanisms behind Pigmented Female Carcinosa with Pelvis and Calf Mascara.
The review focused on the role of pigmented cells, their cellular activity, their morphology, the cellular localization and the functional significance of cells throughout the human female genital tract.
The review discussed the unique physiology of Pigmented Female Carcinoma with Penis and Calf Mascara, which are considered potentially pathogenic to the human and to future generations, as well as the potential for drug therapy.

11,Ground Truth,among the extraordinary adaptations driven by sperm competition is the cooperative behaviour of spermatozoa by forming cooperative groups sperm can increase their swimming velocity and thereby gain an advantage in intermale sperm competition two accordingly selection should favour cooperation of the most closely related sperm to maximize fitness here we show that sperm of deer mice form motile aggregations then we use this system test predictions of sperm cooperation we first show that sperm aggregate more often with conspecific than heterospecific sperm suggesting that individual sperm can discriminate based on genetic relatedness next we provide evidence that the cooperative behaviour of closely related sperm is driven by sperm competition in monogamous species lacking sperm competition polionotus sperm indiscriminately group with unrelated conspecific sperm in contrast in the highly promiscuous deer mouse maniculatus sperm are significantly more likely to aggregate with those obtained from the same male than sperm from an unrelated conspecific donor even when we test sperm from sibling males we continue to see preferential aggregations of related sperm in maniculatus these results suggest that sperm from promiscuous deer mice discriminate among relatives and thereby cooperate with the most closely related sperm an adaptation likely driven by sperm competition

11,GPT-2 Summary,"There are a few caveats to the above, so let's dive into the details.
One caveat is the number of sperm per sperm cell.
It's not important for the present discussion, but as I noted earlier, this number is a good baseline.
If 2 ml of sperm was observed per ml of sperm cell in a single individual sperm cell count was 1/2 at the beginning of the experiment (it was almost exactly 1/2 when the experiment ended).
There is one other caveat, and at the end of this article, I'll discuss this caveat.
As we noted above we have to consider the possibility that when sperm make long term contact with the female they will accumulate into single cells at her seminal vesicle or epididymis.
When doing so, we must distinguish sperm that make contact from sperm that are not.
In the laboratory, sperm cells can be stained for fluorescent molecules called F1c, by their morphology and surface activity.
We know from an observation of female eggs after fertilization that these mature into sperm and those which do not reach the seminal vesicle are labeled according to their F1c activity.
If one drops out after fertilization (a known fact), then the experimenter is able to distinguish these sperm cells from ones with the opposite morphology at the same time, and in turn from cells that are present.
Once we have the probability of having more sperm cells or non-existent sperm, we have to understand what is happening inside our cells.
In female eggs, the male will attach to the female's corpus call"

The patient's history showed a history of moderate to severe inflammatory bowel disease and severe pancreatic diverticulitis as well as hypogonadaloidism and multiple sclerosis.
Saturation is also the primary measure in primary melanoma progression to metastasis.
In addition, the level of hyperaloeubinemia and pancreatic diverticulitis in the past were also associated with melanoma progression to metastasis.
Secondary hyperaloeubonum (and sometimes overt hyperaloeubonum) has been postulated to play a role in carcinogenesis but is far from proven.
The presence or absence of melanoma in the present case is not a conclusive indicator of disease.

14,GPT-2 Summary,"Binding of amino acids in a complex protein is made by simple chains of amino acids, which are arranged in series and arranged in parallel.
Most major proteins consist of such chains, and when binding, the chain's orientation changes to change how much of an amino acid is bound by surrounding amino acids.
The sequence of the binding sites in a protein determines where one protein becomes attached to another.
Each protein chain in various amino acid chains can have two pairs of binding sites, or four pairs of binding sites.
When binding from the binding site of a different protein, the binding can be either at the top of the chain or bottom.
A set of chains is labeled with two adjacent amino acids, or two adjacent residues, and another set of chains has one adjacent amino acid.
This process, called amino acid sequence homology was developed and further characterized by Prof. I.R.
Trewavas: it allowed more precise calculations of complex protein interactions by allowing one chain of amino acids to bind a different protein (one chain can bind a protein of the same family, for example.
or other proteins).
Binding can be accomplished using the conformational symmetry of the protein chains or the relative weight and size of the chains.
In addition, one or more other molecules may influence the motion of either the first pair of residues or the top of the chain.
In the case of protein bound to RNA, the amino acid sequence can affect the sequence motion of the RNA strand, or vice versa.
The binding is not absolute by any means, for the sequence of the amino acids cannot be determined with the use of single amino acid sequences alone.
The binding is most precise when two or more protein chains have a similar sequence motion.
(The exact process is described by the work of I.R.

17,GPT-2 Summary,"1) Patients affected obese body proportions with medical complications show benefits of laparoscopy.
The results of many studies show the success of laparoscopy in treating obesity related medical problems.
But laparoscopic laparotomy in obese patients result in many complications.
2) The risks of laparoscopic laparotomy in obesity related medical problems are increased compared with laparotomy performed on conventional medical patients, since laparotomy is not always successful in fat patients.
3) Laparoscopic laparotomy is considered an effective surgical intervention in patients with morbid obesity because it avoids many complications.
3.3.
Limitations of laparoscopic laparotomy in obese patients The following limitations of laparoscopic laparotomy and its risks were noted for obese patients: Limitations of fat bypass laparotomy in general in obese patients:
- Fat bypass is not always successful in obesity related medical problems.
Thus, bypass laparotomy may result in prolonged or severe morbid obesity.
- Fat bypass is not only uncomfortable in surgery on obesity related medical problems.
Therefore, fat bypass laparotomy may result in less surgical morbidization.
Limitations of fat bypass laparotomy in obese patients:
- Fat bypass may need to be modified after the patient has been surgically eliminated from obese proportion for fat bypass is unlikely to be necessary at long term.
- Fat bypass laparotomy in obese patients may be more invasive or less successful due to non-compliance rate.
Consequently, fat bypass laparotomy is more invasive than for normal weight fat patients.
Limitations of fat bypass laparotomy in obese patients:
- Laparoscopic fat bypass may not perform correctly as fat bypass is not always successful."

18,GPT-2 Summary,"Artists of modern day are in many ways very similar to our ancient ancestors.
In fact, even to look at the differences in how they paint their paintings is to realize that some of them are very similar to their ancestors.
While you may not agree with our cultural heritage or its understanding of art as art, there are certainly many things that you can come to understand about our artistic heritage.
Artists may have much different personalities than we do.
For example, art historians, who generally agree or agree with our cultural heritage, may not agree with a particular artist.
They may believe certain aspects of art are more ancient or advanced.
They may think different aspects of what a painter paints are similar or very similar to what our ancestors painted, maybe even more advanced.
They may believe specific painting techniques are more complex or less effective than our ancestors would have experienced.
They may think certain ideas about paintings are more significant over some older paintings then others.
Perhaps artists would not have found their way into our art history tradition as recently as some artists that come from the modern age, but might have stumbled across their way into our cultural heritage from the earlier period.
If you want to become an art historian or an art historian educator, start learning and learning a lot about how these different influences, styles and concepts are woven into our art history tradition.
In short, how do you fit together all of these cultural groups, ideas, techniques, history and techniques into your art history understanding of art?
I do not know of anyone that has done that.

But in science, most of the time when a good theory is tested (and many other scientific theories).
In this post, we'll compare evolutionary theory to the physical theory of relativity, the basic physics that all contemporary theories and experiments utilize to measure changes in the overall speed of light with more complex, experimental, and potentially controversial physics.
We'll discuss the physical theory of relativity as the basis for thinking and understanding evolution through a macroscopic and/or molecular viewpoint.

1) ""Labor participation is calculated simply as the total number of workers in a specific time of one's working life.
Labor participation is not divided by the number of months of the season but by the total number of employees working for the employer during the year.
Labor participation rates are calculated using the participation rate from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and include both persons who currently are employed by unions and persons who would want to join unions someday, but have yet to give up their jobs.

26,GPT-2 Summary,"1) sarcoidosis as well as other forms of uveitis associated with the herpesvirus have an associated risk of eye diseases, the incidence depends on which ethnic group is being examined.
While the incidence of leprosy is approximately 0.75%, for any given group of people the chance of developing both leprosy and the disease from one another is much greater.
2) All leprosy/hygiene-associated cancers are in fact much more likely in the Asian population than the West, even if leprosy incidence is higher.
4) There are no racial differences in the incidence of leprosy but a higher rate of skin cancer is observed in Korea.
5) Sarcoids are a very common type of tumor in the eye and contribute to ocular disease.
Some studies are suggesting that sarcoids can develop into cancers of the skin.
6) Some studies have suggested ocular sarcoids may be involved in several inflammatory diseases.
However some studies suggest these findings are not true.
(7)
TL;DR:
1) there is little evidence of an association of the herpes virus with multiple sarcoids, although sarcoids and other uveitis occur.
2) African Americans and Asians have about half the incidence of any major infectious diseases
3) Sarcoids are a more common cause than any other of uveitis.
4) The Korean population has much lower incidence of leprosy and scandinavians than the West.
5) There are no differences on the presence, frequency, size, or size differences between the ocular"

27,GPT-2 Summary,"What is LASIK?
LASIK is performed on all new surgical candidates regardless of a prior history of surgery unless there is significant risk to patient.
In addition, it is the most common type of procedures in the United States to perform surgery based on laparoscopy.
More advanced laparoscopic surgical techniques allow for less invasive and faster laparotomy.
For some reason this is one of the largest areas of need for laparoscopic surgery in the United States.
A patient presenting to the emergency department of a newly diagnosed patient with a major surgical risk condition is treated like any other individual.
What do we do, What do we need, Why don't we do it?
This is my point of view, which is based on medical experience.
I am a total stranger.
I'm looking for the answers.
I'm an expert in surgical risk research, surgical risk counseling counseling and other such topics to understand the medical situation and come to some conclusions about this case.
I feel this may be a valid concern for the majority of the American community if only because (1) more than half of the U.S. will attend for their first sighted medical procedure; (2) this is the number one cause of medical complications in the overall medical community; and (3) it is not unusual in this country as many surgeons, even among the top 10 surgical specialties, are having similar surgeries without patients.
All too often, even those with prior knowledge about the individual risk of doing something else, often lack the training and experience in doing the correct procedures.

28,GPT-2 Summary,"Men are much more likely to score higher on psychopathy traits than women.
Men are also far more likely to be perceived to possess greater psychological distress due to their gender.
Taken together, these findings suggest that men are much more likely to score ""high"" on psychopathy traits in spite of women not possessing any psychopathology traits.
Therefore, men are likely to develop psychopathy due not to physiological factors, but due to social factors that may be influenced by social norms and expectations.
Furthermore, men may indeed have greater psychological distress due to their gender because people may judge them by their social situation and perceived social status.
A good explanation of this study comes from the fact that these men are young males who happen to be married to highly educated women who are also highly intelligent, competent, and well connected.
They are therefore likely to be the men which will receive psychopathologies because they are highly valued for their abilities and therefore are highly valued by others.
This leads to further implications regarding the psychology of psychopathy.

31,GPT-2 Summary,"
The sexual revolution of the sixties marked the arrival of biological engineering and an ever more radical critique of sex ethics.
The emergence of biological engineering led to radical changes in all aspects of our sexual lives: sexual pleasure and erotic desire came about with it a new sexual morality arose from it both as an ethical stance and as a theoretical foundation.
The ethical justification of the sexual revolution in each case, then, will be considered within a broad framework.
This blogpost continues in the post Sexual Revolution, the Sexualisation of the Brain.
Before going into my analysis of biological engineering sexual neuroscience would provide some generalisations that some have already made in discussion.
But what I will present today is an expansion of material I wrote on this topic in The History and Future of Ethics to include many topics still left unanswered: the philosophical foundations of the sexual revolution, sexual desire, and the biological basis of morality.
Let us start with sex.
First of all, I should define a few terms.
For now, I won't use the word'sexual' because of the cultural nature of this term, although most of what I am talking about is, on the one hand, sexually active.
On the other hand, I should also say that sexual behaviour and feelings do not, as there are other terms which would more directly describe it, refer to the same nature.
A heterosexual male who enjoys sex can sometimes feel like he's not, on some core level, sexually attracted to another male.
In some sense, we are not sexually attracted, but rather this may also include a sense that there is somehow not actually much in common with another person.
While such experiences are very common, there is no such thing as such a thing only men can experience in the mind's eye, which we now term sexual desire.

32,GPT-2 Summary,"For me, the main issues are: (1) How important are some specific processes?
How would one go about measuring these processes?
(2) How far back into the history of an organism are most of my species species considered (i.e.
in any given environment)?
Have I identified any processes that would require a DNA sequence?
(3) If so, when?
The first question arises as I try to create my own model using only the information that I can get from the available data.
First, I must first find out what'systems' are available.
Is an organism an 'insect' or does it include any sort of life or a bioreceptor (with or without a genome)?
How would organisms respond to that?
If you know your species, take the time to collect specimens.
Look for one of the many species, including some of my own and those that I have seen in the wild, and record their locations.
Look for'spores' as well--these are what they generally look like in the adult stage and can then be sent for analysis.
These spores may also be available for you to use when you do your analysis.
Most of the life that I know of involves the activity of a nervous system, as well as some form of communication.
Other organisms that are known to be'mammalian nervous systems' require a variety of inputs, such as vibrations from insects, or gases produced by insects.
There is certainly nothing in nature that requires any sort of complex communication between organisms, although some species may need some input.
While every organism is complex, there are certainly some things that seem like"

34,GPT-2 Summary,"A woman has a right to control her own fertility if it is not threatened through abortion or birth control.
She should be able to control her own reproduction, regardless the circumstances of conception.
Fertility control is a human right.
A woman should be able to choose.
Because abortion has become illegal in nearly half of developed countries throughout the world in one generation, many women still resort to risky and often unintended approaches to end their pregnancies.
The current ""birth control"" narrative encourages women to go ahead at any cost to circumvent medical treatment as they would like to prevent a pregnancy.
In many cases medical providers are afraid to prescribe contraception without knowing the risk of an unwanted pregnancy, especially as it is often not available without financial assistance.
This leads women to choose to have a surgical abortion instead of having an abortion if it would pose significant, but reversible, risks.
The risks of death and injury are far higher than using birth control as they make a life-and-death decision to destroy the life they have built up through natural sexual activity which is often fatal.
If, like most women I know, you have not taken control of your fertility the birth control is only another means by which to kill that life in order to destroy your body's ability to give birth.
Women's deaths must not be permitted and must end to ensure the survival of the many people who are not able to afford a medical treatment of any sort unless that treatment is provided under the most extreme of restrictions.

Eating fish is estimated at 300 million tonnes per person per year
World's wild wildlife population could be depleted in less than 15 years
Wildebeest is estimated to be extinct without effective conservation measures
World's human population is expected to reach 10 billion people by 2050
Humans now consume 40 tonnes of fresh water every third day
There are around 16,000 mammal species
Horse population in the world is believed to be less than 1 million
A single fish can contain as many as 1.2 billion cells (that's 8 gallons)
It was estimated in 1995 that at peak fishing capacity the world's wild freshwater fish stocks alone are about 2.5 million tons
To understand this impact, humans must consider our daily interactions with the wild and to the oceans.
We eat fish in order to gain their trust and the value they provide us in many ways, such as:
Pets
Cleaning and petting fish
Towing and loading boats
Purchasing fish from stores
Bartering, selling, buying, sharing, selling or buying on special occasions as well as everyday food gathering activities.
Food We fish fish do a number of functions in the world.
They provide food, shelter and other basic needs to many species.
However a major function of fish food is to provide food for us humans to eat.
The fish we eat is a food source for other animals, such as birds and mammals.
It provides us with protein, vitamins, proteins, fats and minerals.

37,GPT-2 Summary,"Dentine is a major constituent of tooth structure with very high bioavailability from the diet.
Dentin is widely used in dental care for numerous indications.
The mechanism leading to dental fluorosis is believed to be based on a lack of hydroxyapatite in the dentine.
There are a number of factors which may act to increase fracture resistance due to tooth structure.
However, even though dental fluorosis is a common condition with a significant burden of costs, there may be alternative, non-cavity treatments such as dentine enamel supplementation that may be effective when used appropriately.

38,GPT-2 Summary,"Drug safety considerations are a major contributor to how much and which drugs we are prescribing.
Pulmonary arterial bypass techniques have a history of developing complications associated with use.
The authors of this article highlight potential risks associated with their use with pulmonary artery bypass therapy in comparison to dual or single antiplatelet therapies.
They urge patients with pulmonary artery bypass to continue to use dual antiplatelet therapy until demonstrated therapeutic benefit can be measured in controlled clinical trials, specifically, in subjects with multiple cardiovascular disease and high risk pulmonary embolism.
[13,15]
The risks and risks associated with dual antiplatelet therapy, the use of single antiplatelet agents, and the potential benefits of dual antiplatelet therapies are summarized in this analysis:
There are no known side effects for dual antiplatelet therapies of this class.
There are some recent reports of the use of clopidogrel in patients with pulmonary embolism but those were limited due to problems with the drugs and were not randomized controlled trials.
[3,20,23]
In order to determine the risks, effects, and potential benefits of dual antiplatelet therapy, they discuss each possible side effects and potential benefits, and discuss possible differences between their respective options and prescribe their use in the treatment of pulmonary embolism.

40,GPT-2 Summary,"Sodium polyacrylate glycolic acid is a low density membrane protein with broad structural flexibility due to its flexible shape, multiple sub-membrane amino acids, multiple non-glycosylated structural elements, and a simple polymer scaffold interface.
Lipids or proteins are generally understood to form the outermost layer of a cellular membrane.
However, understanding how these materials bond to the cell membrane is a challenge.
Different models have been proposed to estimate protein size within membranes, but these models provide limited information about the size of protein.
The structural diversity of membrane proteins, as well as the chemical properties of polymers, all determine their structural organization.
Phylogenies related to membrane proteins have elucidated an overall structure that has been related to the cell's cell transport.
Although membrane protein organization has been identified, the molecular mechanisms underlying its transport are yet to be adequately resolved.
Two major theories have been related to transport.
Protein transport
The first theory holds that membrane protein transport is the process by which proteins or polymers attach themselves to the cell membrane [1].
In their model the protein is transported through glycolysis to the cell cell membrane.
Protein transport is therefore believed to be a key mediator in cell membrane transport but the exact mechanism by which the glycolytic effect occurs is not fully understood because different types of proteases in the same type of protein can either directly and efficiently transport the protein or they can directly and efficiently cleave the protein into multiple amino acids.
In the latter case, the cleavage may be facilitated by membrane protein binding.
Transport by amino acids.
The second theory is that transport is not a simple process from one cell to another but an integrated process due to a coordinated movement of different proteins as the amino-"

41,GPT-2 Summary,"
In this article we'll be looking at another great service provider, we'll follow them from year to year as they're growing and they come out with new ways to save time and money.
I don't have any direct experience with healthcare providers so you'll have to play with the examples and learn how things work.
We'll do our analysis using their web site because we know how difficult the services are.
I'll only share my recommendations and try to come up with my own personalizations.
So I'll be using these examples from year to year only as they're relevant to the services I'm looking at.
That way you'll get an overall view of the current care structure and how that affects cost to give you a better idea of exactly what services are available at any particular date.
For example, if I need to check to see how many patients were born in an earlier month, I'll use this example from 2015 and get an overall idea for what's available during the year.
I'll use a couple of this services in particular but will also cover ones that are currently a must-have for me.
If you're looking for something specific I'd recommend going back to this post to see what the current care is like and how it's changing.
Let's see what we can come up with and what kinds of services are available.
Hospitals

Hospital costs can vary a lot depending on things including the patients you see, and what the hospitals are.
But let's be conservative and assume it's the same across all hospitals.
But what about the patients you see?
The average amount you'll pay to see a medical facility is $12.20 per visit.
And these are the typical costs in different parts of the country:

Northwest US, $14.20 per visit

Midwest US, $15.00 per visit

Great Plains US, $23"

42,GPT-2 Summary,"To summarize, there is extensive and growing knowledge about how to identify, identify, and treat a patient's anxiety disorder for all clinical, psychiatric, and behavioral aspects of their disorders.
For some clients there are specific issues that can cause anxiety or dysphoria and for others that are normal to not exist.
There are currently several drugs that can aid in diagnosis and treatment of anxious patients but there are currently many unknown problems.
As this article outlines, understanding the mechanisms of anxiety can be incredibly important to understanding how to tackle certain patient groups for whom anxiety management strategies may be lacking.
The authors have been unable to conclude a definitive path for anxiety management outside of research, but they propose a few ways for effective management:  1) Diagnosis - there are currently few validated treatments yet that can lead to resolution of an anxiety disorder.
2) Treatment - while some specific treatment modalities may be successful, many others may work poorly.
3) Cognitive therapy - while some techniques may be helpful for a patient with anxiety disorder, it is difficult to give patients the cognitive training that would lead to reduction of their anxiety.
4) Social support management - while some research confirms that there are differences in how positive family relationships are affected by treatment, there are also studies that have linked anxiety to family dysfunction and difficulty in providing for family and personal well-being.
For example, low education and lack of support may be related to anxiety treatment outcomes in women.
5) Therapeutic intervention - there are some techniques for preventing anxiety that may improve the overall quality of life but clinical effectiveness is not yet proven.
There are also some studies that suggest one approach may lead to more effective treatment.
Overall, there is much to be explored in addressing anxiety-driven mental health related quality of life for individuals of"

43,GPT-2 Summary,"The answer is yes.
It will take a while for many studies to realize this, but we are on our way.
This is what NASA says:
NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) published a study today claiming that for the first time, the universe is about as compact as is observed.
Its findings are based on data from an infrared telescope located about 100 light-years away from Earth.
The telescope, called the Wide Field Infrared Survey Explorer, can only see infrared wavelengths, and so it produces images of the universe that seem infinite in size even when the telescope's optical lens is blocked.
""The paper is based on information found in the data that is only available from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope in visible light,"" said the study's lead author Robert Grunsfeld, NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies.
""We know the universe is actually about 20,000 million times longer than what we thought.""
There is some concern that some astronomers may be misled on the accuracy of the calculations made by scientists and theorists and have taken them at their word.
It is very likely that the actual length of the universe we see exists at least 1 trillion years behind the time they originally calculated and hence, it could be billions of years smaller than has been acknowledged.
(The time scale may well be much longer!
But only in the realm of the possible.)
Even the current Hubble Deep Field Telescope might be 10 or 1/100th the resolution as can be seen by the visible light, and some scientists doubt that will ever be sufficient for us to see the entire universe.
If these measurements were accurate, we wouldn't even be able to detect dust grains orbiting the sun, but they may be far too faint to be detected at the"

44,GPT-2 Summary,"I'm one of those brave people who knows a lot more stuff about big bones than most people, so the first thing I'll say is that the biggest bone in the world is probably the middle one which has a much smaller surface area than any of the other giant bones of the world combined.
The reason why a lot of the giant bones of the world are so big is because some of them have been destroyed on impact.
Other giant bones with very narrow surface area like the middle one (which is the one over-exposed right now) haven't been damaged, so they're quite similar size to all the other giants, in the sense that they've been ripped out of the earth by people like the dinosaurs and the Sumatran megapods, because they were already pretty large when they were destroyed.
It turns out that the middle one (basically the middle bone) has a giant organ that was exposed to an enormous amount of force and was completely crushed to death by being hit and that it was completely crushed.
The middle bone is actually quite good looking in person because with the help of a camera the people of the city just made it look like a bunch of pieces of marble.
The middle bone has two smaller plates with one small plate on the left that we're talking about because it's not as sharp as the other plate on the side; whereas the other plate was very thin, but if you sliced it, it would crack a lot of open space with the force of the crash.

46,GPT-2 Summary,"We studied the relationship between parental health and outcomes at 5,9 months of age, and also for the long term after 12 years of age (mean 2.8 years).
We conclude that at least some negative consequences of depression persist with longterm follow-up rates were moderate (10%).
The current literature on maternal depression is far from consistent.
Given the fact that depression onset is related to maternal mortality (8), it provides an opportunity to examine these risk factors and predictors of future events.
We present our results with additional information about possible interactions of maternal depression onset with maternal mortality and morbidity risk factors.
The results also indicate that this risk factor association does not hold independent but may interact with other risk factors, including age and poverty, social determinants of health, smoking status, exposure to exposure to stressors, family functioning, and child health.
Finally, we propose a set of novel risk factors for long term mental health problems that may be associated with lower long-term depression prognosis even at 5 years.
TL;DR:
We examined the relation between parental health and outcome at 5,9 months of age and at 12 years of age.
We found no consistent research on the association between parental health at 12 years old and future outcomes at 5 years.
However, with several prospective studies of mothers and children we found a strong association of maternal depression at 5 years with depression at 12 years.
In particular, a protective effect of depression at 12 years for future risk factors was found for social adversity, the mother's life stress, and pregnancy.
We propose here novel risk factors for long term mental health problems and consider that this would affect mothers and children from birth.
This study and additional research on the association between paternal health and offspring health may eventually provide insight into the protective effect of paternal health on offspring health"

47,GPT-2 Summary,"1.
Tumor cells from myelomyeloma are not affected by dextran-induced hemolysis or cytotoxic effect of dextran on myeloma cells (a review of recent literature).
2.
In vitro studies demonstrated that in vitro dextran therapy reduces thymidine, phenylalanine and methionine hydrolysis by increasing thymidine level and thus induces cell death.
In particular, dextran led to the inhibition of the hydroxylation, thioesteration and deoxyribose utilization of leucine in tumor cell culture.
3.
Dextran may also induce apoptosis in multiple myeloma cells when applied to T lymphocytes when tested with S100B and S10C-1 human leucine knockout cells.
4.
In vivo studies found that dextran treatment leads to enhanced migration of multiple myeloma microenvironments.
We conclude that dextran can induce apoptosis and subsequent tumor cell death in multiple myeloma through an unknown mechanism, which affects tumor cell growth and migration."

52,GPT-2 Summary,"CLL is a genetic abnormality affecting more than 200 million Canadians with the estimated number of people on this list possibly 1.5 million in the United States alone, it is thought that 1 in 500 children and one in 40 adult Americans will have this genetic defect at some point in their health.
We know that genetic mutations occur as a result of the cell division and we know that some genetic defects can persist for a lifetime, but do you know what genetic mutation is that most common at any one time?
We can estimate that roughly 1 in every 5,500 of these 1 in 500 cells are abnormal and that these abnormal cells exhibit some of the same pathology and are the reason for most of the reported clinical signs and symptoms associated with CT.
(1.)
Inflammatory cell death caused by the production of excessive cell adhesion molecules as is observed in the most common and widely available diagnostic tests for CT are known as CD34.
These abnormal cells show activation and are known to produce inflammatory cytokines (4).
Other cytokines may also be produced in the CLL caused by cell death (1,5).
Cells are known to be ""proliferating"" during cancer growth when activated antigen receptors (ANTRs) are produced that promote cell growth, survival and survival of subsequent cell divisions (2).
Since these receptors can also cause abnormal growth in other tissues, including bone, the presence of these receptor-induced cells is considered as a cause of osteoporosis and other major joint and osteoarthritic problems.
We still aren't able to identify the specific gene responsible for this abnormal cell growth/survival response."

So for once in my 20 year career I'm going to take something that was a pretty interesting blog post with me to another level, rather than just saying ""no thanks!""
That said, there's never been a better time to write about what is going on with the heart in the 21st Century.
As the heart is often thought of as one of the most mysterious and delicate organs in the body, many people think they have a pretty good idea of what is going on, or why.
I like to think if you ask anyone, they will tell you exactly why.
The main thing is that more and more people are losing their lives because they have simply stopped exercising or getting healthy.
A new study has found that in the past decade heart attacks involving heart failure increased by almost a quarter:
The average age of death at the time of death of all adults is 64 years.
An estimated 9.35 million Americans have heart disease, which accounts for about one-third of all deaths.
A total of 13.36 million US adults will live beyond age 70 years as a result of heart disease.
These numbers are a result of the rising number of heart attacks caused by heart failure.

54,GPT-2 Summary,"The concept of a ""tagged"" gene is very straightforward and has been largely established by recent research.
A tagged gene can be used to create unique functional complexes, or functional complexes can be found to have function even when the tags are not attached to them.
A major challenge for those creating proteins, has is identifying what tags are most useful for them.
One such problem is that there are no specific ""tag strategies"" or ""tag-types"" of proteins.
In some studies, the tags are all tagged at the same time.
This is simply not acceptable for the large majority of applications and could end up creating confusing tags if applied to different types of data.
To avoid this, we have devised the concept of ""tag types"".
Each has it's own tag scheme:
Tagging requires complex, complex, complicated, complicated, complex, complex, complex, complex and complex tags.
A unique tag structure can help when working with large data sets because that will identify the most efficient and productive tags in which the genes are targeted.
For example, the tag structure ""proteins"" can refer to proteins that are designed and synthesized from non-transmembrane carbohydrates and are part of the biosynthesis process.
Some proteins that are not bioorthogonal or with a tag structure don't have specific biological uses.
These could include small molecules (eg.
amino acids), proteins that are used or required for tissue engineering, proteins that contribute to biotechnology, proteins that may be useful for drug discovery, proteins that may target specific bioorthogonal receptors, proteins that encode a bioorthogonal function for the enzymes in the enzyme's biosynthetic pathway, etc.

I was only able to preserve the last five years anyway.
I took them to see two of the doctors in charge of looking at the records, and although I did try telling them that I wasn't sure how much of the records had expired and when I could actually look at what had and what was still in there, I was told by one of the female doctors that they also couldn't find anything about me.
After a rather difficult wait of over an hour, with my family crying, while I told them exactly how I felt about my records being withheld by the county, they ultimately agreed to release my medical records without their consent.
(My last five years of medical records, after all!)
My sister and brother, who are in their late 20's, had gone through the hospital after a car accident.

- Estrogen and cancer have significant and complex interplay and it is important that future studies are directed at evaluating potential synergistic mechanisms, i.e.
whether low birth weight reduces cancer risk associated with increased estrogen exposure or whether breast cancer should be included as a case control in addition to other risk factors.
In the article that I had to send you earlier from my doctor they were discussing a postoperative history with me that had nothing to do with my cancer.

The patient was told to use my own lung.
However, despite having previously attempted to breathe the patient's lung as she was still intubated, the procedure was done under her skin and she was then able to breathe without the assistance of airway.
The patient has since died from lungs full of fluid.
The surgeon also noted that the lung area within the body may have a larger impact on its breathing capacity.

61,GPT-2 Summary,"The concept of comparing different clinical trials involving different psychiatric conditions is important with limited access as much as possible
Methodology


The term 'clinical trials' refers to a multi-stage design that combines randomized clinical trials (RCT) with control periods that allow for comparisons between trials, clinical outcome measures, and covariates

This approach allows for comparison of studies with small groups, as opposed to randomised controlled trials and therefore should provide more detailed statistical analyses as to the effect of the individual trial for which statistical inference is more appropriate.
The authors attempted to identify six of these characteristics of controlled trials when using the four-component method on the quality scores and on studies available in PubMed with the following two variables

– quality score 'A', which is a combination of the following variables

C-sample, random sample, or single group (ie.
the individual participant who completed the trial).
Mean difference between random and control groups

Overall AUC

Proportional AUC, relative-to-interquartile range (IQR)

The six characteristics are grouped by study and the type of statistical procedure applied:

Quality scores

The authors described how three of six measures were used to develop the score:

– quality scores, are derived from the analysis of randomised controlled trials using standardised reporting of outcome outcomes (e.g.
mean difference between random and control groups), with quality scores ranging from less than 1% to more than 5% on overall mean difference between control and randomly chosen patients (QD), as well as mean difference between random and control groups (QD-R), mean difference of treatment arm (eg.
difference between second line treatment versus first line treatment), and maximum value of the difference between second line treatment and first line treatment."

Conclusion
This study has addressed questions regarding prevalence and prognosis of cognitive and psychiatric diseases in aging groups.
The results revealed that almost one third of over 100,000 subjects are of age 65 years and over one hundred fifty thousand individuals are elderly.
Overall, older people are prone to cognitive dementia especially cognitive dementia affecting many neurocognitive functions namely memory, learning, reasoning, visual processing and visuospatial performance.
It should be noted that most major medical diagnostics such as MRI, EEG, CT scans, PET are now available, which has also enabled researchers to identify genetic factors involved in the development of these neurocognitive changes.
The findings of the study suggest the need for developing better diagnostic instruments (for Alzheimer's disease, dementia and dementia related neurodegenerative disorders), including MRI, EEG, CT scans, PALS, PET, PET-PC, KEGG, and PET-MRS.
These future clinical tools can help to determine the underlying causes of aging and lead to better prognosis for these conditions as well as to facilitate the study of common clinical factors.
It should be noted that various biomarkers such as DNA methylation, beta-amyloid protein and the inflammatory cytokine interleukin 1 alpha have proven to be useful clinical diagnostic markers for Alzheimer's disease, dementia and dementia related neurodegenerative disorders.
In fact, this combination of biomarkers is thought to be more likely than either genetic factor (which is also affected by environmental factors) alone or individual susceptibility (which is affected by genetic and environmental factors), resulting in a better prognosis for age related neurodegeneration.
Further studies are needed if appropriate to understand the underlying mechanism or biological mechanisms involved.

The gold man of nanoparticles.
In these weeks I have picked up my own precious collection of nano-materials and have been using them all throughout the day and night.
The materials include Gold nanopfications, Gold particles, Gold nanoparticles as well the usual Gold nanoparticles which are useful.
In short, I've gone back in time.
I picked up something from my long forgotten father and now I'm back in the present!
And here's some tips on selecting materials, or what you should be wearing!
I started blogging an article called A simple approach to choosing different material nanoparticles based on size and shape.
At the time I was only studying nanoparticles, but now it's time to take things a step further and consider materials such as gold nanoparticles in addition to nanopatterns.
Gold nanoparticles, or gold nanoparticles that can be mixed into any solid, as I know it has long been known.
In fact I am only doing my part in understanding nanoparticles.
There will likely also be good news with regards to gold which was found to be as safe as silver, yet still is a very difficult material which might affect your life.
I hope you take along at least one gold nanoparticle that you enjoy.
Many different types are available.
I've written a few more articles on gold.
First of all let me say thank you so much, Dr. R. M. Mehta.

Dr. Stannard and Dr. Beale found that people who drank at least one glass a day of beer and wine and regularly drank alcohol for an average of 1 hour on average had a 3% lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease (1.6 for an alcoholic drinker, and 0.25 or 0.8 for non-alcoholic drinkers) and a 22% lower risk of being diabetes (1.4 with a non-alcoholic drinker, and 1.3 for the non-alcoholier) compared to people who don't drink alcohol at all.
My wife also drank for at least 20 hours a week.
We didn't find that alcoholics drink more because of it's ""addiction"" or alcohol has been a cause for the deaths of several people over the years.
It is true that I could not find any research that linked drinking over the day to an increased risk for blood cholesterol at night and in the morning.
However, that is not to say the higher alcohol consumption will not lead to problems for you and your family if you're eating a high sugar diet, but you know that you won't be eating that much.

We were able to identify a patient over 2 months after diagnosis with sigmoid colitis (sigma 2) who had a clinical record on at least 6 similar cases of upper urinary tract inflammation with no obvious diagnosis.
As sigma 1 is relatively treatable with antibiotics, you can add the ""sigma 2"" to your list.
As an illustration, I'll quote this patient's presentation in a follow up: I felt this was ""the same thing"" several months later.
On my last visit, the exam was complete with no further symptoms.
When I received MRIs, sigma 1 was elevated.
I felt an acute abdominal pain the next day, also, there was no obvious infection.
I went to an ENT (extra abdominal surgery) doctor, who did the biopsy and did not feel anything until 3 days before my exam.
On the exam, there was an abdominal discharge with a deep red streak on the left wall.
I asked him the patient's age, he said around 14 years old (probably 17 years) (see also here from a patient).
The patient had sigmoid colon prolapse, which is very severe since the rectum was removed using a ureterosseal technique (upper abdominal surgical procedure).
He had no symptoms until 10 days after surgery due to sigmoid colitis, during which time he started to bleed and my doctor told me the patient had severe abdominal pain.
From the time to 9 days, the patient was stable, and no further clinical improvement was seen.

What is the Global Gamblers Initiative?
The Global Gamblers Initiative project is an ambitious plan to help reduce global gaming sales by over $3 billion.
It has been criticized from some quarters for including very conservative estimates and ignoring factors like foreign currency exchange rates.
In contrast, other recent articles have suggested that gamblers on average earn less than $75,000 per year for their gaming participation.
I don't know the exact number behind the US gaming industry.
The industry is growing quickly though many large cities in South America have recently started gambling and developing a strong reputation of being a world class and safe haven for gaming.
In general, gaming is a global industry and most of their customers are not natively American.
The Global Gamblers Initiative, if enacted, may even affect Americans as well.
The gaming industries spend $70billion annually per year while the average American spends over $6 billion annually on gaming.
According to Forbes, the American government allocated roughly $1 trillion dollars to gambling in 2012.
This means that if the U.S. government decided to allow foreign players to enter the US game industry it would likely reduce the revenue of the industry by 1.5 billion dollars.
But let's keep things in perspective.
When President Eisenhower signed the Foreign Investment Act into law in 1956 (the first law of its kind), he believed that Americans didn't understand that the foreign countries where they are investing had to be part of the same economy as America.
The same is true with the United States government.

Patients with acute pain syndromes and predisposes the treatment for acute pain including orthopaedic, gastrointestinal, neurocognitive and neurochemical disorders also appear favourable after taking the appropriate treatment for acute pain including anaesthesia.
Acute pain with central nervous system involvement can be defined as pain which occurs on the surface of the eye or within the eye socket by the neurophysiological mechanisms of the central nervous system, the intercostal muscle, the brainstem, the skin, vascular system of the eye and the interleukin systems.
Anesthetic and/or neuroimmunologic treatment has been provided in general anaesthetic services.
Anesthetic has been associated with less long-term, less painful and a more precise diagnosis than neurochemical treatment as anaesthetic has not been associated with a longer time or improved surgical outcome (Finn, 1993).
Orthopaedic surgery is associated with a much greater complication, particularly brain surgery, than the neurophysiological associated neurochemical-related acute pain syndrome (PAS).
""When pain is acute, the brain will have become over activated, the pain will be directed in many directions, and the patient will experience intense and very unpleasant pain""
""Bilateral and bilateral analgesics, like ropivacaine, are administered in various levels of the upper limb to reduce pain, but they can also reduce pain intensity as well""

71,GPT-2 Summary,"A new class of antibiotic resistant bacteria has been identified and isolated from a patient's feces.
What makes this particular culture different is not the number of cells present but the amount of DNA produced.
The finding of a new class of antibiotic resistant bacteria from fecal material is not what initially made it a priority for a group of researchers.
What does the research group focus on now besides the possible cause was the discovery of four proteins involved in the assembly and cleavage of the novel drug resistance gene encoding the bacteria.
These proteins are known to be present on every human cell so while a single bacterial cell can produce different proteins it is not uncommon for hundreds to be involved in production.
While the results of this study will have implications throughout the entire development of antibiotic resistant bacteria within our body it appears that the proteins associated with the new class of bacteria is specific, meaning it is only found at particular sites and targets and not the entire genome.
TL;DR: It starts with what type of organism and where.
It ends with why that particular organism was caught off guard to find what could be the culprit in this particular species of bacteria.
A study on antibiotic resistance in faeces from people has revealed that nearly a billion people in the world have no access to basic medical procedures, due mainly to antibiotic resistance.
The discovery of one particular pathogenic or antibiotic-resistant bacterium that was capable of producing a strain of the same bacteria that can be grown in the lab has raised concerns among researchers and experts alike that the human body already has a growing list of antibiotics"

72,GPT-2 Summary,"A few years ago I started getting regular mammograms from my daughter who has multiple breast cancer.
The results were very good and very similar to a breastogram she did 2 years ago.
When she got into her mid thirties I asked her about her past problems with cancer which included my breast cancer and decided I could not continue to have my daughters scan her to keep everyone safe.
This is where I ended up sharing an article which explained my dilemma.
It turned out that my daughter just had a normal mammogram of her ovaries which she passed on 3 weeks to a friend with multiple breast cancer.
As a result the friend also had a routine mammogram which showed two ductal carcinomas (DTCs) at the location of the ovaries, one of which had been removed a week before to stop it from spreading.
I then discovered my friend was treated with chemotherapy as well at the time and was advised to stop chemotherapy.
These factors lead me to my question.
When I do the mammograms, I do them just right, even before I have talked about what I find in the data, and I have not given any information about why I choose to do mammograms.
I suspect this is because I know the answer will be different for different women depending on their family history, location of the tumors and if that affects the way I do my own analysis.
So for now, with no additional information about other women, should I stop using my daughter's mammograms or how to use them?
The answer is no.

Angiographic features are a direct method for detection of coronary arteries for all heart diseases, however the sensitivity for predicting coronary atherosclerosis may be lower than current conventional techniques.
Furthermore, in clinical evaluations, the risk for coronary artery disfunction increases significantly with risk factors such as age and hypertension.
This study highlights the increased risk of cardiovascular disease for young adults between the ages of twenty and forty six who are living in the developing world.
Key words:
Cardiovascular disease

Cardiovascular risk factors

Cardiovascular disfunction

Inflammation/disorders

Risk factors for chronic disease (e.g., arthritis, hypertension, inflammatory bowel disease )

Cumulative risk of coronary heart disease for young adults in developing countries at risk from smoking/smoking associated disease (e.g., obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer)

Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of all causes of death reported globally.
Heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide at least fifty six million in the year 2010.
In the world, approximately seventy eight million people are currently living with heart disease.
At present, almost all Western countries report high mortality rates of heart disease with hypertension and stroke having higher mortality rates than a coronary artery disease at twenty years of age.
Worldwide, approximately eighty two million people who are at high risk for atherosclerosis have chronic disease and suffer from cardiovascular disease.
Cardiovascular disease in developing world is caused by the accumulation of damage and damage accumulative in the vessels of the heart causing the accumulation of a coronary lesion.
This pathological state develops gradually over the years and can be reversed for the patient by coronary artery bypass surgery.

My goal, though, is to provide a bit of a picture of the evolution of species by showing what organisms have done and how they have done.
Many examples of animals from the fossil record include many examples with a development of different types of creatures, but I'm going to focus on something from the early evolution phase of a life cycle.
Mammals as early as 5 million years ago were primitive species of reptiles and birds.
In this earliest form there are several basic principles, which are all derived from the idea that animals are an integral part of a more holistic evolutionary tree, and that we cannot see this idea without looking at animals' developmental origins.
1.
The earliest living creatures were simple: They were simple cells, with no muscles or organs to extend, and no cells to use its contents, like in eukaryotes which are also quite simple.
In a primitive creature, they must be able to move independently.
Two examples of that are the primitive crocodile and primitive fish which, being primitive cells do not possess any motor functions, but they also do not possess a nervous system for movement, like our own vertebrates.
2.
The earliest living creatures were primitive enough to do things like form nests: they developed with minimal organ function but they had enough function still that as they matured they could put aside the organ functions and put the nest together.
That was only after they got enough function, so it probably took them time to do this.
In many animals including birds and reptiles, these early nest forms of organisms are much"

When we think of a person, as we are wont to do, we often look to the ""self"" image and make sure that we are focusing all of our attention on that one.
This tends to get us into trouble at times when we consider how many people we know, for example.
This article attempts to take a step back in thought from that perspective, to consider that self-image, and instead draw some concrete rules for behavior.
Here's how it might work:
In this paper, I will be exploring a cognitive model of self-regulating decision-making, focused entirely on the representation of what it makes to consider what we actually do (just like it does to you).
When we consider which option to pursue, what is most likely to happen: the one option that is best, or the second or third one?
What is an optimal outcome for us?
What is the relationship between various attributes of the self and the outcomes we are most likely to get from pursuing it?
How can we think about action more clearly?
That is to say, what information about ourselves is most likely to come out best and most accurate?
So, here the representation of self is to be judged in two different ways, one way regarding action: what is the most beneficial?
And, the other way, what is the most reliable?
Here are ten questions/constraints/challenges/instructions for your next experiment in mind:
1.
Do you want to know what is actually going in the brain to decide?
The answer to whether self representation is actually real or just symbolic is unknown, but it would seem reasonable to use a simulation model.
How would you interpret it?
How would you explain it to someone else?

Noise is a major hazard if not managed responsibly.
Don't do anything to protect babies as a parent.
I was born in 1987 with a mild hearing impairment and never experienced hearing problems during life.
I developed hearing problems after birth due to the stress of living in an environment with lots of radio noise.
I had to listen to several hundred kHz for months as I grew.
Before I went to medical school, I was concerned that it might be detrimental to my hearing that my baby could hear.
I had to be monitored with an audiology machine for a few years following my delivery.
By early 2000, my hearing had developed into that of a normal, healthy baby.
I remember walking around at night with my hearing problems, listening to sounds of lots of different intensities for nearly 60 minutes, listening to my children crying outside, and playing around the house as my hearing returned to normal.
When I was an infant, I had to listen to TV for the entire day as my mother slept until I woke up.
This led to hearing of a lot more.
It was hard work, but it was a necessary evil for my life.
In the late eighties, my father and I came from Germany where the only sound that was loud enough to keep my head above water was Radio waves or low frequency TV and was generally heard only by children.
There was no other noise on the planet, so noise was an essential means for survival.
My hearing was normal by high school, but after that level of noise, it was normal for me.

78,GPT-2 Summary,"This week we will be covering a significant piece of the story related to the topic of eating disorders and the way the medical industry presents and talks about our experiences.
This is a piece that should surprise no one, considering how commonly it is used.
1.
What are eating disorders and why are they so frequently ignored?
A lack of understanding on an individual patient's behalf, as well as a reluctance to engage in a careful medical consultation can also lead to the mis-diagnosis of eating disorders as not being caused by genetic factors like obesity.
These two factors create the vast majority of patients being misdiagnosed as eating disorders: ""they are not related"" ""there is no genetic element to the disorder.""
In a sense there is.
Anecdotal evidence provides a good foundation, but it does not prove anything.
We hear this all the time, ""I had an eating disorder when I was younger, my mother wasn't aware, and she just knew how to feed me.""
I can attest to this, although I don't know if my mother was unaware or just too ignorant or lazy to do something about it.
There are three problems:
1.
This is a generalization.
Individuals with eating disorders can have no history of eating disorders at all.
Many will have a history of eating disorders for years, despite not having one.
2.
There are many possible causes for eating disorders other than genetic as well.
As discussed later, the vast majority of eating disorders are due to genetics, but there are certainly others not mentioned above and there will definitely be more still to cover.
3.
These doctors don't do their job.
They are often poorly trained and misdiagnosed as psychiatric when their knowledge is outdated or they get worse and worse as diagnoses go"

This means, as explained in the previous paragraph,
A biosynthetic agent is converted to the bioelectronic material through a series of mechanical or chemical reactions.
These chemical reactions, if allowed to succeed, generate a unique bioelectronic material and then bind it to the desired target biomolecule (a protein).
In a 2D biomimetic environment, 3D printing and biomimicry are not different enough for us to call them distinct systems, but this fact does not necessarily mean that each technique does not impact one other method.

A short overview of the plant pathogens is presented.
We analyze the plant resistant genes (e.g., root pathogens, yeasts, microorganisms, eukaryotes) and then discuss several plant resistance effects.
On the other hand, a much longer and more detailed summary, including more specific results about the root pathogens and eukaryotic plants is also presented.
We analyze the root pathogens, yeasts and eukaryotes, especially those that infect roots of plants, and discuss how different species of organisms use the root pathogens to infect or reproduce.
We discuss important questions that arise when plants are infected or even survive or replicate in another organism or animal, and why certain plant diseases and pathogens may be resistant to certain diseases or others.
And an analysis of specific resistance genes that contribute to resistance is presented.
While resistance has been largely neglected in plant medicine, we are currently actively researching this issue.
Plant resistance genes are emerging as the most important genetic vulnerability factors related to plant disease resistance in modern scientific knowledge.
Despite it being the second most abundant type of transgenic gene, most plant resistance genes are not conserved across plants.
This review includes a brief description of key plant resistance genes, and discusses their mechanisms of action.
We also discuss how and why new plant resistance genes will make a difference in the treatment of plant health and disease.
As shown in the figure, plants are increasingly becoming infected or reproducing with other plants or plants that are genetically resistant to root pathogens; hence resistance to root pathogens and eukaryotic pathogens is also an increasingly important pathogen control problem for various plant species and populations of plants.
The plant pathogens are very complex, and there is more than one pathogen that can cause any disease.

The molecular basis for complex progression of cancer is supported by the molecular understanding of cellular senescence.
As cancer progresses, the cell undergoes cell division to create multiple new dividing units that are then subjected to mitosis transition and proliferation.
Cellular remodeling, proliferation, proteolysis, and migration are triggered by the activation of many cellular processes to create a state that mimics senescence.
In vivo, cell migration occurs, cell cytoskeletal changes, the formation of adhesion junctions, the production of apoptosis, the transport of signal molecules from the membrane to the cytoplasm

84,GPT-2 Summary,"First a brief overview of the evidence.
Second, how the impact on public health of a non-overlapping cohort of patients with foot conditions similar is likely to differ among patients using custom made shoes.
A decade ago, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of non-overlapping cohorts of people with toe problems to evaluate the effectiveness of shoes.
In 2009, FDA revised the criteria to be more in line with current recommendations [26]
Since then there has been renewed interest and controversy around non-overlapping cohorts of people with toe disorders in general and in particular the use of custom made footwear among high performing patients for chronic foot pains.
One prominent source is the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES), a non-profit dedicated to the evaluation of conventional and custom made footwear.
ICES is widely considered to be one of the world's most accurate resource for assessing the impact of custom made footwear on patients who have had type 2 diabetes.
When I reviewed the literature about patients who wore custom made footwear, I found that while there had been some evidence that shoe-based services and treatments might increase adherence in those with diabetes with type 2 diabetes, no randomised controlled trial was found to indicate that custom made footwear increased adherence to lifestyle change or any other treatment outcome (i.e.
quality of life, quality of life index, or improvement of quality of life compared with non-custom made shoe-based interventions) in either the usual patient population or in non-customised patients who might otherwise have had type 2 diabetes (i.e.
people in middle aged households in non-customised clinics).
In my opinion, if patients don't need shoes, why spend our money and our attention on them?

86,GPT-2 Summary,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may contain foreign materials that affect an individual's health and behavior, especially when ingested outside of a medical setting.
Although in a single sample from a patient, CSF also contains the following factors:
- Human fetal bovine serum
- Human serum albumin
- Hormone.
The use of this terminology could raise doubts in the medical community about patients who are unable to recall exposure to foreign matter such as foreign body matter or when exposure to foreign substance was limited to the initial treatment of inflammatory lesion.
For instance, when I went to the emergency department (ED) for severe diarrhea last summer, I found it was not uncommon for my patients to go into a coma or convulsions after ingestion of what we thought were food particles.
I remember asking my ED physician after presentation about this phenomenon.
He said there was nothing unusual and that the patient was doing fine as far as she was concerned.
He asked what I wanted to know was that the patient's condition would improve or develop differently if they did not ingest anything that was in fact foreign.
Because I did not do much research into whether the ingestion of food particles was hazardous to health, I was unable to determine whether I had misinterpreted what the patient was experiencing.
The first example above is concerning if only I had been able to do much data gathering about this topic.
I must emphasize however that the above example illustrates that not all patients may be as susceptible as others to foreign, or foreign substance, contamination in CSF."

92,GPT-2 Summary,"The fact that the NHS is run is not all bad!
I wrote a longer piece last year on improving the delivery of care using the NHS system.
This blog post is just more details on what I have learned so far.
If you find them helpful, please let me know.
Thanks!
What is a Healthcare System?
An integrated, cross-organizational system is a system that helps people find health professionals to treat themselves and others for illnesses such as cancer, heart disease, arthritis, heart disease, diabetes, stroke and more.
When an individual becomes sick, the NHS must ensure that treatment and care (or lack thereof) are accessible to all who need it.
The NHS and the public health system are not separate entities.
A public health system in many countries has a set level of care that is delivered through a network of providers which in turn operate a chain of public services that help people with the various illnesses that people face and how they can manage a range of diseases and conditions.
These public health systems are very similar to the NHS in many ways.
People rely on public health officials for their treatment and help with their medical needs.
They have access to free and discounted physical and prescription medicines and other medical services when they need them.
In the United States for example, free healthcare insurance to provide healthcare or a medical assistance program to assist people with health issues like cancer, HIV infections or other ailments will result in many individuals needing hospitalization.
These hospitalizations are usually funded through fees paid by government, typically those who receive medical assistance (Medicaid) or through Medicaid to pay health insurance premiums on the taxpayer.
The United States has had extensive reforms in healthcare delivery, as the ACA (HealthCare for America reform) passed in"

Electrical Conductance Current Transfer NANOWIRE ELECTRONICS 2.3.
Cell Electronics Nanowires for cell electronics nanowires and electrical devices are used for biomedical electrodes.
Nanowires are generally regarded as being extremely important in electrical conductance transfer.
They improve the efficiency of conductivity transfer by making potential changes to electronic circuits possible at very low temperature.
A very important function of nanowires is to control electronic properties such as electronic state change.
In its most basic form, the conductivity of an isolated cell, or of fluids with electrochemical properties, is maintained at constant levels at low temperatures.
The lowest state at which the cell can attain high molecular weight is called solids state.
At equilibrium, if the state of the conductivity of the cell drops or rises by a small value - 0.01 mCi in free plasma - the cell achieves a maximum mechanical moment at the point P (see figure 1 A-1).
Cell cells with the smallest state - 0.01 mCi in pure plasma - can be shown to show a large increase in dynamic stability, particularly for the most important properties of biological cell behavior such as signal transmission, ion transmission and electrochemical conductance.

94,GPT-2 Summary,"Sorting, filtering, and interpreting large population data is complex, in the traditional manner can be incomplete, and may be inappropriate since a number of variables may have differing interpretations.
Given similar studies have shown significant differences in effectiveness rates between groups, it's reasonable to assume that the differences may result from different methods.
Data analysis can reduce this issue by attempting to identify the variables that affect efficacy differently.
Sorting, filtering, and interpreting population data is difficult because it can be more often difficult to isolate variables that make a difference than to measure interactions (e.g.
interactions between several factors).
Data can be fragmented in that data may have been collected across different time periods, sites, participants, and study populations, or data were collected prior to an application of an intervention.
Other sources of heterogeneity and/or inconsistencies that may affect findings include: group membership, whether a particular intervention is provided to the same persons, the type and purpose of the intervention, if there are other potential interventions besides lifestyle changes, the duration of intervention, whether a study is designed to be a 'randomization trial,' whether a study can be repeated, and whether the data are analyzed before or after the application of the intervention.
These factors complicate applying the results of this paper and can make finding commonalities less important.

We discuss the use of genome and genotyping data in food genomics research and analyze which parts of the genome are not considered food crops (a particular focus of our analysis).
2.
Consistent with our hypothesis for rice agronomic diversity, we discuss what factors or combinations of factors contribute to species geographic diversification across multiple geographic regions, how those factors contribute to global food production and the importance of rice as a major food crop.
3.
We describe the importance of food crop traits in improving food security, using data from rice and a range of other food crops.
We examine how the diversity of traits in rice genetic variation may impact climate change and how this impacts rice agronomy, especially as rice farmers adjust to increased climate variability.
Further, we examine how the variety of crop traits in rice makes it even more vulnerable to weather disruptions, how this influences genetic diversity in rice, and how this influences food security.
4.
We conclude that, despite the difficulties inherent in genotyping rice genes, the use of data from rice as a food crop provides a unique opportunity to better understand genetic variation in foods, including rice, for the purpose of improving food security.

I had talked about the journal idea with my graduate advisor but I wasn't planning on publishing at the time.
However the idea came around and inspired me to find a publishing house for my new journal: 
I contacted our marketing services contact to learn if this would be a possibility, I was assured no.
So this idea was born, and we started work as soon as I knew I had some good funding.
After the initial meeting I asked my mentor to come to my office for a meeting, she was a wonderful and helpful woman, and I felt so strongly about this idea.
She was there when I started working on the website to try and raise some funds, she was the one who was the first to reach out to someone  who needed help.
I am so glad I chose her!
I feel so blessed that she wanted to help and that I am helping.
Then later on the marketing service came out so that I could actually do production and distribution!
Her support made everything much easier, thank you from the bottom of my heart!
I was very happy to find my first sponsor.

2 - II.
Toxicity to humans and non-human animal is largely due to nanoparticle use
3 - III.
Nanobiomaterial nanoparticles (NMNA)
4 - TL;DR:
All the toxic nano particles on the market use for nano batteries are also used in all the harmful nano material products.
If you are reading this website please take note that we use the word neurotoxic because they are all used in the product name.
What the term actually means for us is the toxic effects of toxic nano particles which are extremely toxic and can be very toxic to people and animals.
Let me give you some examples of this.
In the above graph you can see the toxic and toxic effect nano particles has on human health.
What the term nanoparticle refers to are those particles that have the surface area and size of nano-articles but they are smaller and are composed of other particles smaller than the ones in the graph.
When there is a single particles particle that's area is bigger than the size of the particles.
When particles that are nanoscale particles like nanoparticles or nanotubes (small size particle), that have surface area of about 100 micrometers to the millimeters and are composed of other particles smaller than the size and size of the particles.
So when a particle has the size and shape of particles, size and shape alone are important but when particles have other properties as well like their shape and size.
A little more.
It's called nanosilver in the graph.
In a different chart you can see the toxic effects of nano metal nanoparticles

100,GPT-2 Summary,"If you're interested in learning about these concepts, keep reading.
The key part is the structure - they are just as important in your life as doing math.
All of these themes work together.
We don't do research to find the new, more profound knowledge; we do it to find the old, the deeper knowledge.
In the short run, any breakthroughs that come across don't last long; in the long run they spread.
One way of analyzing those trends is:
The longer you leave your head - the deeper the unknowns that arise from the body of knowledge.
This is where science and mathematics come together.
A major challenge is finding ways around this difficulty.
If we can do that - we've already come close.
This has been the challenge for generations.
This first part tells us something basic about how economics and science work: The body of knowledge is vast.
But the world is very different from the literature.
Economics is a set of laws that are universally agreed upon by all people in science and the public.
By nature, science is messy; it takes years of work and research to come to a consensus.
In the literature, science deals in one way at a time - from theories and assumptions to studies, experiments, statistical tests to mathematical applications, and, perhaps most important, theories of how things work.
As you go through the literature, you come across theories and assumptions that are not agreed upon - in other words, non-standard.
It's that uncertainty that keeps us from seeing the next big breakthroughs which, in turn, keeps us from seeing problems which have never been seen before.
This brings us back to the question: What's in there we don't know?
How is that knowledge built up?
The answer is as important as the question on which it is put.
The second part is what I call the ""discovery method"".

102,GPT-2 Summary,"To date no evidence exists to demonstrate efficacy of this device that has any potential for rapid or painless refraction reduction.
The device is still not approved for use.
A better, pre-clinical evaluation of the risk of injury, safety, and efficacy of the device is needed.
We need more randomized controlled trials to determine what safety is and is not acceptable in our pre-clinical studies.
We want to get our findings in clinical trials so that we can find that the device produces a benefit at a cost that patients cannot justify to cover the patient's healthcare costs.
To do this we have a responsibility to report on the results of our pre-clinical studies to the FDA and to the industry.
Our role is to make that happen.
The current paper has shown that there is much about this device we did not know, but we knew a lot.
We also have been working on refining our research methods for several years and can make these improvements easier.
We should have been able to obtain a preliminary trial that we believe showed efficacy in treating refractive, macular, or other central vision impairment.
The cost of the device is also high.
We can expect to spend between $70 and $8500 for a week of the treatment, of which we don't expect to spend more than $8.
We also have high risks.
We have published a few observational trial data on the device showing its effects on quality of life, but not of patient satisfaction.
For us that risk is probably outweighed by the risk that our results might cause the implant to be rejected.

A nonpolar colloidal system comprised of water-soluble nanoparticles containing one or more hydrophobic colloidal materials, a first group of nps has the optical properties described above but the other nps has the optical properties mentioned above but not the physical properties.
An amphiphilic band is attached to one or more nps to increase electrical conductivity.
When the colloidal solution is dissolved at approximately 40oC, the NPS in solution has a solubility ranging from 0.5 to 5.0molar/100g (100g).
If the solution is then treated at 1oC with a water soluble polyvinyl chloride solution or a water soluble sodium chlorite solution and treated for 1.5 minutes before adding the next solution it will hold a solubility between 50 to 100molar/100g before its solution is removed.
NPS solution then has a solubility ranging from 0.8 to 10molar/100g (10g) on treatment at 40oC and 100oC.
The colloidal nanoparticles then lose nearly 50% of their electric charge through this reaction.
The colloidal molecules are then subjected to a second solution reaction.
The first solution in the colloidal water is the first with a higher solubility and it contains a significantly larger number of nonpolar nanoparticles and therefore the second solution has a lower solubility and therefore the second solution has more conductivity.
The structure of the colloidal nanoparticles then allows for more or less stable bonds between the nps and the nanoparticles and therefore for improved"

106,GPT-2 Summary,"Most of the femoral fractures occur while walking/jumping over solid objects causing a large number of fracture related injuries in both legs.
Some of the lower extremities are treated by manual intervention.
Femoral fractures occur at an increasing rate over time while high profile traffic accident events occur.
The femoral subtrauma tends to grow more acute during the years, as the femoral subtrauma develops is increased in strength.
The more serious femoral fractures occur in association to high impact collisions, but also may occur at non-impact collisions.
In this paper, we examined fracture rates that occur with high impact and near impact collisions, in combination with general population data.
Most of the fracture rate that is identified as dangerous (10%) occurs during these high impact collisions.
The more severe injuries are seen at low impact collisions (5%) and near impact collisions (6%).

107,GPT-2 Summary,"When is hcv infection actually fatal?
First thought that some infections are fatal and that there are no known way to prevent them but hcv not only causes chronic hcv but also causes severe and permanent damage which ultimately leads to liver damage, liver failure, cancer and death.
This paper will provide a summary and explanation on the different stages and molecular mechanisms causing human influenza viruses which lead to disease progression.
We will also try to understand the mechanisms that cause viral replication and also how some viruses infect humans.
We will also review the common hcv strains and try to predict where each individual hcv was found to cross, compare hcv strains of different countries which have different hcv prevalences and how these differences might be explained to understand the differences in virus pathogenesis and virus infection.
The first step is to address the question why is viral infection not fatal?
This question is easily answered in various ways and it is difficult to explain or even comprehend, but I will try (if you disagree please feel free to comment - do please provide as much detail as possible!).
The basic reason why people sometimes believe the mortality of hcv is higher than that of most other viruses is because the viral infection causes significant damage to most of the cells that it is infecting.
For example, hcv can cause severe cell death and organ failure which can cause severe illness in humans, there is a significant risk for cancer and even death if the cells that are damaged are not properly protected (for now).
In the past, there have been no clear clues for the biological mechanisms by which hcv causes such health risk.
Hcv is often linked to hepatitis C, hcv can also prevent hepatitis C but the molecular mechanisms have yet to be fully investigated.

109,GPT-2 Summary,"* Antivenom has been shown to slow the mortality of stings on venomous snake bites, but only at low doses (≤6 µg/kg/d) using intravenous instillation.
Although it is possible to administer active antivenom without adverse effects after stings with other snake species, the antivenom for stings with scorpions is more expensive, less effective, and may not function as well as active management
* Active venoms are likely effective for stings with scorpions, but probably require more intensive treatment at lower doses before optimal efficacy can be observed.
* There is some evidence that reducing the venom dose associated with stings in order to improve stinging outcome might decrease mortality from non-malignant stings, particularly in children and young adults (though whether these adverse effects outweigh their benefits is unknown).

110,GPT-2 Summary,"Yolk balls increase size with height.
Working distance reduced by 30%.
The size restriction, compared to the previous somite placement model, has no impact on working distance.
However, yolk sphere does allow for visualization of the next somite.
Yolk sphere allows for stable specimens in a stable environment.
Yolk sphere allows for a fast and accurate visualization and shows the smallest size constraints for the size of the somite.
The yolk ball in a tissue block does its best job of helping the somite grow longer into it's surrounding.
While the yolk block was not used, the visualization of the next somite made possible by the yolk sphere would allow further optimization of size at the stage of visualizing one final somite.
Strain control works by giving greater control of visualization than what is available with other ways.
The restriction of length to keep the somite at a specific height, with ease of visualization, limits size constraints.
This method does well with larger somites, yet does not impose the limits on length to keep the somite a specific height.
As with the yolk sphere and staining, it's more likely to visualize a single somite and use the other methods in the field of cell culture.

Yolk and Staining
To create a yolk block, you need to do the following first.
First, you need to prepare a yolk with a syringe made up of 8-10 g of liquid chromatography--a more fine-scale approach where you can use a higher amount of solvent.
An equal concentration of solvent should work fine, but you might want to have more liquid so the concentration is greater.

113,GPT-2 Summary,"As much as we care about this issue, the current consensus is that obesity and its consequences have not been proven reliable.
That's why the issue is being studied the way that research was originally conducted and because the lack of definitive information has brought us to where we are today.
This article will attempt to address this issue, by considering and reviewing studies that actually are working to understand the topic of obesity.
The World Population Health Organization's first five-year plan for aging has been widely panned by the health community as evidence that we are losing our ability to adapt to this global age problem.
They have argued that it is not possible to meet our projected 4.6 billion people with increased productivity by 1% per year and that ""the only realistic approach is greater resource efficiency.""
This is also one of the core assertions of population health, that we can only reduce the proportion of our population using improved resources if we also focus on reducing the proportion using less efficient resources.
Despite the success and criticism, there are still many things to improve about the current report to be done.
Firstly, the report includes only four categories:
Age, physical activity, nutritional adequacy and functional status.
However, they are only four categories, and each category should be considered alongside all the others.
For example, health at a young age, health at an older age, physical activity and nutritional adequacy should not be included in a given category as we do not all need to continue with the same path.
A further reason I would be interested in a more comprehensive and updated report from this group would be that one has not seen any systematic attempt to assess the magnitude of the problem, and there is much to disagree on.
This article will address four cases of obesity-related morbidity.

115,GPT-2 Summary,"I would say, if vaginal mucosa was examined as a microbial environment, then more advanced bacterial infection, as a consequence of which bacterial vaginosis has become a concern in the majority of pregnant women, could be the result of an improved immune response and a higher colonization/antibiotic tolerance of the microbiome.
The result could be a higher risk for recurrent, complex chronic, progressive, and long-lasting symptoms that can take up to four weeks to resolve within a normal pregnancy and that lead to an increased complication rate in the mother and fetal host.
However, because antibiotic prescribing remains pervasive in the United States, I don't think our current knowledge of bacterial microbiome and vagal balance is sufficient to address the potential long-term benefits of antibiotics.
Furthermore, the data is sparse to suggest that vagal balance itself predicts subsequent vaginal disease in pregnant women who've had a vaginal infection on one or more of the preterm birth indices (the GADS) when compared to pregnant women who've had a vaginal infection on the previous preterm birth index and not pregnant.
In addition, the association between vaginal inflammation and preterm birth with this increased risk is consistent with a second finding of the present study suggesting that bacterial vaginosis may also influence the risk for recurrent, complex, and prolonged vaginal disease in pregnant women.
This may provide further insight into the biology underlying the relationship between these conditions and colonization/antibiotic tolerance."

When the right gum was removed at the dentist's office on the fifth day, a third was removed in the same time frame, and there were still additional teeth still present on the third day after pulling teeth; therefore, both left and right gum extraction were performed incorrectly.

117,GPT-2 Summary,"CNS disorders are a major public health issue with wide medical importance so many scientists are passionate on a non-specialty subject, specifically neuroimaging.
More than half all published research into the causes of neuropsychiatric disorders was conducted in the last thirty years and the majority of these findings are considered controversial.
While the role of endogenous peptides may lead to the development of new treatments, it seems as though these findings provide only marginal support for their efficacy.
CNP biomarkers have now been discovered and widely used as potential biomarkers for many disorders.
CNP analysis has also been used to detect neuropathology; however, this approach does not distinguish between normal and abnormal brain behavior.
Although these technologies provide novel insights on CNS/CNS disorders and should improve our understanding of the causes of disease, there is no evidence that they are predictive of the majority of the clinical course in the majority of neuropsychiatric disorders.
The use of neuroimaging (primarily using positron emission tomography, PET, and fMRI) and neuroimaging techniques in diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease remain controversial.

The age at which a female lay a pair of eggs changes by about three weeks.
The percentage of chicks that produce eggs at age four weeks is higher than in older eggs.
Practical application of these results will make it possible for hatcheries to produce eggs much higher in yield with fewer unwanted eggs, which is essential for improving animal health and reducing suffering during times of famine.
The best way to avoid this problem?
Have better hatchery staff that will not be bothered by the production of unwanted animals and to help reduce a number of risks which impact the care and safety of both animals and humans in the care and management of laying hens and broiler chickens.

We present some relevant information regarding the evolution of treatment approaches, the current status regarding the development and rationale for drug resistance in epilepsy, and our experiences as doctors prescribing drugs and drug resistance in a variety of epilepsy patients.
Current Progress on Neuromedicine

Progressive efforts towards treatment of epilepsy have been characterized by the increasing number of drugs which are not only effective but effective in combination with an additional mechanism to treat epilepsy.1

Treatment with novel treatments such as lithium, lithium parabens, benzodiazepines, and anticonvulsants has been suggested.1-3 However, there is a lack of reliable evidence to support the efficacy of such drugs specifically with patients with refractory epilepsy.
A good case record of lithium using a drug-sensitive paradigm was recently presented: the efficacy of lithium, but specifically in neurogenic epilepsy, was enhanced by the use of the lithium-dependent antidepressant lurasine, whereas the efficacy of the amphetamine-based antiepileptic drug risperidone was lost and improved due to a combined approach taking advantage of the effect of the two drug systems.16 A review of placebo-controlled, double-blind studies for anticonvulsants have not yielded significant beneficial effects in children with refractory epilepsy,5 though clinical trial results of prochlorperazine in patients with epilepsy, and an exploratory pharmacological study on prochlorperazine in patients with refractory epilepsy show improvements in the treatment of seizure stabilization but no improved clinical outcomes.15,27

120,GPT-2 Summary,"First, a small subset of patients is likely in need of specific treatment for low serum aat as compared to people who have normal serum aat levels and do not develop any signs and symptoms of any type of deficiency.
Second, there appears to be a relatively small subset of the population for whom any treatment is warranted and with this small subset of patients the overall risk is relatively low, and the risks are likely to be manageable for a patient.
Because a small subset of people with a deficiency will need a certain number of standard treatment regimens, it may be impractical to prescribe a single drug type to treat the whole population, as we don't know if all patients are at risk for low serum aat.
If these risks are considered, it would be appropriate to look at the risk for these patients and recommend a combination of a high specific serum aat dosage (or at least a significant dosage) and a high general serum aat dose, and perhaps a special type of thyroid treatment if there is severe low serum aat.
This is because of the risk that patients with a low status of aat could be at higher risk than the general population.
This approach should be taken when a patient has been known to suffer from low serum aat for some time, but would require very large doses of serum aat or treatment regimens to overcome low serum aat, potentially with the risk of side effects.
For example, if a patient has an A1A1 or A2A2 mutation resulting in low serum aat (or a combination of this and other mutations).

121,GPT-2 Summary,"
Clavicle fracture may occur spontaneously after heavy weight lifting (weight training) or when using machines such as lifting bicycles because of insufficient support of the glenohumeral joint to assist in holding onto the weight and to stabilise the motion of the pelvis and shoulder.
Clavicle tends to become dislocated and it affects the shoulder due to its small size.
Patient treated with conventional shoulder and shoulder ligament grafts must be given painkillers to maintain function and must be followed closely from 1 July 2014

A single shoulder clavicle dislocation usually represents a single fractured shoulder, however one may have a more serious joint dislocation resulting from multiple shoulder injuries and may require surgery including clavicle dislocations.
The exact cause of joint dislocations is unknown.
Although Clavicle Fractures, Joint Dislocations and Glenohumeral Disorders are not always treatable the following may help us to reduce the consequences of these devastating shoulder injuries:

Injuries should always be considered in a patient's best interest only; there is too much uncertainty about possible consequences for overall patient condition given its low certainty.
In some patients, additional injuries may cause further problems with life.

He found that the actual oxygen concentrations in the blood are not so different for the oxygen saturation of the blood.
There is, however, a direct relation with blood pH.
TL;DR3:
Haldane suggests other variables may contribute to oxygen level and oxygen saturation than oxygen concentrations.
His idea that there is an indirect relationship between these variables is supported by modern science and many studies he conducted on animals.
tl;dr: Haldane did not find a direct relation between blood pressure and oxygen levels.
He did not study the oxygen differences between the blood and the air.
He found that blood pressure was not as important as oxygen saturation."

125,GPT-2 Summary,"– neuropsychobiological hypothesis proposed by researchers neuro-developmental hypothesis proposes a role for dopamine and glutamate as key neurotransmitters in learning and memory and suggests that mesolimbic pathways contribute to the mechanism controlling the learning process.
There is much more detail (see for example: http://www.skeletal-biology.net/dopamine-and-glutamate.html).
– one study, from 1991 suggested anhedonia in rats based on a dopaminergic mesolimbic pathway that in humans causes poor memory performance and depression and in mice, anhedonia is caused by reduced dopamine activity.
Other brain-derived neurotoxins (also known as neuropeptides) are believed to affect the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway in different neuropsychological systems.
Other brain-derived neurotoxins are important neurotransmitters for learning, memory and cognition.
Summary – ""Methamphetamine abuse increases mesolimbic dopamine and serotonin excitability.""
Here's the relevant paragraph from another review of the research:
"" The evidence for an increased mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway activity is consistent with the observed behavioral and neuroendocrine effects of cocaine and nicotine, and the suggestion that excessive dopaminergic tone could play a causal role in addiction risk emerges from several well-documented case studies of methamphetamine users.
For example, several authors have reported that patients with bipolar depression have impaired performance on tasks related to working memory, emotional processing, and other aspects of attention and focus.
In a sample of 18 methamphetamine abused individuals with comorbid psychotic disorders, a high level of methamphetamine use was associated with both reduced work (and/or creative) ability and poorer psychom"

131,GPT-2 Summary,"Eulerian equation ( Eq ) approximates classical equation ( Eq ) which is also based on the principles of quantum gravity in this paper, there are several important reasons for including a molecular model and that are discussed below.
1.
Molecular Models As well as the general Eq, I am also exploring how to describe complex systems of which a molecular model is the basis.
Some molecular theories describe in terms of a molecular structure.
Examples include the basic helix theory of molecular orbitals which holds that all the basic units of molecular structure are hydrogen (H).
Helix theory is generally considered to be the simplest of molecular theories which have only three of its six basic units – hydrogen, protons and electrons.
Helix theory can be extended to the other four of the basic units, making a total of seven basic units, including the six that are the seven basic hydrogen units.
To explain how a molecular theory would evolve into a Helix-based model ( Helix ), we need a mechanism for generating molecular structures.
A molecular theory that represents the molecular structure to be described is described by Eq(helix).
Since molecular structures are inherently ordered, it is quite clear that Eq(helix) can represent any basic function represented by Eq(helix), and any basic function that is ordered in some way.
However, a particular ordering, such as molecular orbitals ( helix ), has peculiar properties.
For example, as hydrogen atom is in a superposition of different states, some of these states are ""rotating"" in phase, like the spins of protons.
It can be shown that rotational state is more stable, like the spin of electrons.
This can help us to describe molecular orbits, because rotational states are invariant at low"

132,GPT-2 Summary,"When the physician asks or suspects a patient of having a blood problem their initial answer is to be certain no blood is in or present.
This seems to be true in the majority of cases when the presence of blood is suspected, but is much less so in very specific case situations where blood is present and an abnormal or invasive disease is suspected.
It has always been known that blood flow increases and as a result there is an increase in vascular permeability.
This has never been more apparent than when in contact with a patient with an incurable disease and blood is not present!
And sometimes that's what they see.
In his  Journal of Cardiology paper  Borgo has investigated vascular changes and it is surprising to me that he doesn't think a blood test for this is ever more common place with regard to doctors.
When patients are advised to consult with the physician and that patient is being advised to present an ultrasound scan, or that their CT scan shows blood in a vein and that blood is indeed present, they would do well to ask whether that ultrasound showed more of the ""normal"" distribution of blood vessels and vascular permeability.
This is the real question and if you can't answer it for some reason that's a good sign that the information you received didn't come from the correct source.
When I was a young orthopedic orthopaedician, I could spend hours examining the ultrasound image and trying to determine which vein was actually present there, and my questions of a particular vein seemed to indicate anything from ""no arterial flow to no blood circulation"" to ""not at all"".

134,GPT-2 Summary,"- The use of endovascular techniques for the diagnosis of renal arteriovenous fistulas (RTF) can be complicated because of varying patient expectations and sensitivity to endovascular techniques, often due to variations in clinical assessment of renal disease.
- Endovascular techniques can be combined or alternatively excluded because of different clinical, surgical, radiologic and radiographic findings at clinical and radiographic examination.
- High levels of variability are associated with specific findings but include high levels of abnormal communication, blood flow, capillary action and vascular function.
- Endovascular techniques are less widely used in practice than they were four decades ago, especially when compared with the use of non-percutaneous endovascular techniques.
- At this time endovascular techniques seem to be a key diagnostic option for patients with renal arteriovenous fistulas, but we do not have a clear understanding of the potential diagnostic utility of different endovascular techniques for different patients, because of the diversity of clinical findings.
- Endovascular techniques are a valuable diagnostic option for patients with renal arteriovenous fistulas as they are non-percutaneous and the presence of a history of renal arteriovenous fistulas, for example due to renal stone disease, is a strong risk factor for developing endovascular fistulas.
- Endovascular techniques, when combined with non-percutaneous methods, offer more reliable and clinically relevant findings in the identification of renal arteriovenous fistulas but are more subject to variability as a result of lack of knowledge on the appropriate patient presentation for each study."

136,Ground Truth,the mammalian oculomotor nucleus receives strong aminobutyric acid ergic synaptic input whereas such projections have rarely been reported in fish in order to determine whether this synaptic organization is preserved across vertebrates we investigated the gabaergic projections to the oculomotor nucleus in the goldfish by combining retrograde transport of biotin dextran amine injected into the antidromically identified oculomotor nucleus and gaba immunohistochemistry the main source of gabaergic afferents to the oculomotor nucleus was the ipsilateral anterior octaval nucleus with only few if any gabaergic neurons being located in the contralateral tangential and descending nuclei of the octaval column in mammals there is nearly gabaergic inhibitory inputs thus the vestibulooculomotor gabaergic circuitry follows plan that appears to be shared throughout the vertebrate phylogeny the second major source of gabaergic projections was the rhombencephalic reticular formation primarily from the medial area but to lesser extent from the inferior area few gabaergic oculomotor projecting neurons were also observed in the ipsilateral nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus the gabaergic projections from neurons located in both the reticular formation surrounding the abducens nucleus and the nucleus of the medial reticular formation have primarily been related to the control of saccadic eye movements finally all retrogradely labeled internuclear neurons of the abducens nucleus and neurons in the cerebellum were negative for gaba these data suggest that the vestibuloocular and saccadic inhibitory gabaergic systems appear early in vertebrate phylogeny to modulate the firing properties of the oculomotor nucleus motoneurons

136,GPT-2 Summary,"I've found 2 important insights to this topic.
1.
The oculomotor nuclei/visual fields are very similar among the fish brain.
2.
Our data show gabaergic innervation directly controls vertical vertical saccades during normal visual field manipulation, the ipsilateral inhibition of this neuronal system (and it really isn't a coincidence, at all), and gaba's own insatiable appetite as food for the somatosensory gated oculomotor nuclei/ visual field!
The first of these two insights are most obvious when analyzing horizontal vertical saccades in fish, where the fish's vertical eye motions are controlled with gaba action potential inhibition during eye movements.
This study shows the sensory input of gaba via ipsilateral inhibition of visual field motion feedback inhibition and gaba's own insatiable appetite as food for the oculomotor nuclei/ visual field.
Occeolimbic control of eye movements was proposed by Robert M. Culp, a neuroscientist in Florida and a pioneer in developing a technique that could measure oculomotor input directly with the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), allowing for controlled evaluation of the impact oculomotor feedback is having on visual output, even in highly divergent visual environments.
He came up with the idea for brain activity of gaba while observing his lab members and colleagues, demonstrating that the eye movements they reported as they did not match actual visual fields he observed and found significant inhibition of each oculomotor unit (analogous to the oculomotor nucleus).
This is most interesting"

137,GPT-2 Summary,"I've been receiving a variety of new heart transplants for my age for the past few years with many side effects or complications.
The worst side effect of one I had was that my lungs were constantly becoming enlarged because there was so much volume in them.
What this meant was that if one was using everolimus it would cause my tissue to swell up exponentially until it was filled to the brim.
This made it hard for my oxygen level to maintain a stable level.
This has resulted in my lungs becoming bloated as well as my heart rate up.
After using everolimus for many years, the side effect was my heart beat began to slow down.
This isn't surprising since my kidneys are highly dilated (hyperpolarized).
It appears that most people are taking much larger prescription doses of csa than people understand due to csa in many countries being out of reach of the poor people who lack the funds to pay for it.
(In the US and UK my average dose is 50 mcg/day, but in other countries I'm getting 50 mg daily).
I was able to treat my side effects completely by switching to the next most effective method of lowering my medication dose when I had them, which required a constant drip of IV csa in between the medications.
I was also able to have a better long term survival from my cardiovascular transplant because I was diagnosed with type 2 hypertension, which is a metabolic disease that causes insulin resistance.
This led to improved blood sugar control by lowering their levels of glucose to around 80 mU/dl - almost normal.
Although this resulted in very dramatic improvements in my glucose control (lowering my blood sugar below 120 mg/dl), I"

138,GPT-2 Summary,"
-DNA-bases are highly conserved, noncoding RNAs that are able to encode complex genes within the body, or act in some way on target genomes

-Noncoding RNAs are short RNA-like DNA sequences, such as ribosomal DNA, chromosomal DNA, and the ribosomal lysine.
-RNA-bases contain both DNA and RNA, which are usually the same size.
-Noncoding RNAs that code for a small portion of DNA encode other DNA bases on the host genome, and are referred to as ""protein"" RNAs.
-The human genome is comprised of a large part of genome that contains a significant number of noncoding RNAs (cRNAs) as well as other parts of the genome in which the host does not encode RNAs, which will form the host's ""molecular machinery.""
-Although the genome itself is not fully homogeneous in terms of its genomic characteristics, there are some specific regions of the genome that are highly homoeostrict and inessential, and hence highly unlikely to ever contain DNA in the form of RNA.

143,GPT-2 Summary,"I was recently talking with friends about the possibility of a ""monotonically increasing"" food intake, or ""mono-churnal eating"", and this came back to nagging me of course, at the same time I had a ""food reward pathway"" in my head that I am currently discussing.
What is ""food reward"" anyway?
So, as a friend of mine had said 'no problem', but then my thought process shifted around to the fact that food rewards might be a food that we are eating just after consuming the item (if, let's say, we eat ""a banana.
""), and this would involve our brains activating their ""Reward Systems"" (I might know where this is going but I doubt it).
And I couldn't see how this is related to ""mono-churnal eating"".
So as an aside, maybe we should go onto the topic?
If so..I feel that we need to do our research!
And perhaps have some fun with it, I really hope you enjoy.
So, in this context it looks like, ""Food reward"" is a system of rewarding responses elicited both in the digestive systems and by reward-seeking behavior.
Also, ""food reward"" is the only kind that appears in animals and thus it seems to refer to ""reward for food consumption"" as opposed to ""reward for seeking [the usual reward for eating]"".
There is lots more we will use in our discussion however this is just the beginning!"

144,GPT-2 Summary,"An empirical analysis of prescribing practices by national primary healthcare planning organizations in 10 emerging countries (EPOs).
This study included general practitioners from all over countries in emerging countries with high use of prescribed medicines and for whom prescribing practices were not tracked.
The study aimed to evaluate primary healthcare setting prescribing practices, as documented on national registers, by country, health organisation and health provider using an empirically based quantitative and qualitative research methodology.
The study design consisted of 4 aspects: observational study (including survey results), case based investigation, case series, review and analysis of primary healthcare setting prescribing practices, and field trial design.
Study first author, Dr. Ananya Cokhar, reported significant differences in prescribing patterns across EPO countries, with some areas exhibiting ""exact match"" outcomes with non-EPO countries.
Epilepsy was the most common form of seizure disorders, with rates increasing 5 and 9 percent respectively in EPO countries where drugs of dubious efficacy are often prescribed to infants with mild to moderate epilepsy.
Many of the countries also have high use of drugs of questionable efficacy and no monitoring of usage by health care professionals.
The study's design, results and methods were not based on any specific clinical or government recommendations.
It was also not based on any generalization.
Nevertheless, this study has provided an opportunity to further explain some of the underlying factors and factors affecting prescribing practices from a qualitative and quantitative perspective.
The study identified primary health care setting prescribing experiences for drug abuse and misuse in these countries, with one exception in Iran, as illustrated in Figure 1.
All countries show lower rates of use of generics compared to EPO countries despite the fact that this setting has much lower rates of drug-related deaths.

146,GPT-2 Summary,"1) The human immune system's response is one of greatest threat to human health  2) To protect against disease, it needs the proper set up  3) We are unable to make it function against viral infections (most likely parasitic infections) 2) The human immune system's response is compromised by parasites
TL;DR:
Human immunity depends on the immune system to protect against the pathogens.
There are several ways that a human immune system can be compromised.
Viruses and parasites are capable of attacking or being attacked by our immune system.
A number of factors affect the ability of a human immune system to react to diseases, parasites and viruses.
The immune system must include a set of proteins termed the T cells, along with many chemical defense systems.
The immune cells present in our body are part of our immune system.
We each have the ability to have some type of immune cell within our cells.
When we have an attack by a disease it is an attack by our cells that are attacking us.
This is why when you have a cold or flu, or even an infection, when you realize that your immune system is not functioning right, you can feel the pain of discomfort, pain, exhaustion.
Some people simply cannot endure such discomfort such as this feeling that is associated with parasitic infection and can cause a number of symptoms.
When we have an attack, we call it an immune response; other people may not necessarily call it an immune response.
When we have an immune defense against a virus it is called inflammation.
These are the inflammatory cells called monocytes that reside within the blood vessels.
These Monocytes are able to fight off many viruses by making antibodies.

Although a small proportion of patients with TLE have no palpable tumor; nevertheless, there are many patients who have lesions that are benign or treatable: most notably, tumors of the brain (and usually some other organs, including the heart) and chest (which is the primary site for organ tumor).
TLE is often confused with early-stage carcinoma of the bone (the type of disease most commonly associated with TLE).
The tumors responsible for various forms of cancer have also been identified as tumors of the lymphatic system.
Most usually, tumors of each organ can be distinguished from each other; however, in some cases, a disease-specific pattern can emerge.

Here's one more to get you in a better mood.
My wife and I were in bed and the doctor said ""You're sick – you should be dialysis.""
As a little child it really got me psyched for dialysis.
""Okay, okay … I can still get through, but I really need you to stay home.""
So I kept dialysis.
The day he returned home he said, ""Well, you're still hd – I'll just give you two weeks.'
OK, fine.
We've waited about two months.
I'm glad that I was able to stay home, because today, it felt like the rest of the world is waiting for me to get dialysis too.
When I went home and I saw that everyone else was dialysis I felt the callousness (or at least fear) that I had felt.
I felt more alone – because the whole world wasn't there.
After all of this time of waiting, it just didn't make any sense to me that it was coming from me.
When I got home, all I was thinking was, ""I have nobody to talk to.
I don't even know why I'm here and this is all just ….""
The problem isn't that you don't get answers, but the way that you think about them is that you're not able to get those answers because your brain doesn't connect to other things and feels that the time you were waiting was just because it's okay.
But what you really need to learn is how to get out of your own mind and how to find ways to get help in other ways than dialysis without losing your connection to your self.

149,GPT-2 Summary,"Tuberculosis is a complex multi-factorial disease with a variety of acute stages including acute mucosal inflammation mediated by activated T cells ( T cells ), an inflammatory response followed by neutrophoid cells reaction mediated by bimodal neutrophils ( B cells ), inflammation of lymphoid tissues followed by inflammatory activation of myoblasts (myeloid cells), activation of neutrophils/lymphocytes, and infiltration of epithelial tissues.
Mycobacteria are associated with a variety of other infections, such as tuberculosis.
Many acute infections caused by fungi or fungi toxin are known.
The immune system becomes perturbed, causing a cascade of events which ultimately produce inflammatory injury or inflammation of the peripheral lymph nodes called systemic T waves, the T cells.
Most often mild chronic infections cause T waves that are poorly characterized and associated with mild disease.
Chronic infectious diseases such as tuberculosis have also been associated with a plethora of chronic infections that are unknown.
It is unknown how the T cells are generated or how they respond to infection.
The main cause of chronic tuberculosis in western democracies is either a non-tuberculosis bacterial infection or a bacterial infection of the underlying pulmonary tissue (bacteria), and the primary and secondary respiratory tract pathogens are most commonly the gram-negative enteromonas and gram-positive gram-negative bacilli ( gram-negative rods ).
The first of these agents have been shown to cause acute inflammatory, neutrophoid, and lymphoid manifestations, which leads to chronic inflamed bronchial effusions (CAFO), and chronic secondary infection due to their immunosuppressant and antifungal properties.
Although all primary and secondary respiratory infections are associated with acute inflammation, non-infectious respiratory infections (such as tuberculosis) are often associated with the persistent inflammation of the"

RCTs of lifestyle interventions (LRT) are usually conducted by researchers involved with a number of cancer prevention and control (CPR) and lifestyle interventions.

The results of CRIT analyses are often reported in publication and are considered by the authors to be reliable and credible evidence that the intervention is effective.
However, the literature on CRIT efficacy and its reliability  in developing preventive measures to prevent colorectal cancer is still limited.

However, there is compelling evidence that many non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell types and other non-melanoma skin cancers can become tumor-free with appropriate management and therefore stem cell therapy, a non-clinical intervention that includes many of the same factors as cancer therapies, works effectively.
Introduction
The theory that disease may be amenable to medical treatment by activating certain immune cells (antibodies) has been widely accepted since the first reports by LeMay and Sahl and its followers.
This theory, however, has come under criticism for not being supported by experimental research, which, when it does occur does so by showing very little effect and by failing to find convincing evidence of success; most prominent for instance is the hypothesis developed by Sahl on human cancer cell types.
The research on which Sahl's hypothesis is based is widely accepted by scientists, and one of the main criticisms is that it does not support the theory of stem cell therapy in general.
Furthermore, there is significant variation among studies, especially in regard to the exact time course of treatment and at what dosage form.
This review, published in  Cell Biology on January 21, 2004, provides an introduction to the theory that cell destruction is a normal physiologic response to immune injury and that it can be treated by immune response activation and cell clearance on specific immune cells.

A few good indicators for health include:
- a balanced diet that includes the right macronutrients
- exercise every day during your diet
- eating adequate calories to meet your needs on a regular basis and not being overweight
- exercising every day
- eating a healthy balance of fruits and vegetables
- avoiding unhealthy fats and sugar in all kinds of foods and beverages which are high in sugar and high in salt

The 2013 influenza strain isolated at the CDC for the first time.
The UK has become the first nation to officially report that 1 in 10 human cases of influenza is linked to bird flu, and no evidence to date that this strain is linked to human-to-human transmission.
Of the 1,851 confirmed and probable influenza cases in the USA in February 2013, 1 in 10 human cases were not fully diagnosed or identified as influenza viruses.
Public health authorities in Britain have identified 2,723 potential human exposures to this highly pathogenic H7N9 influenza strain.
The vast majority of deaths in the USA have thus occurred since the US public health authorities in that country were able to detect and publicly report that 9 of 10 cases were not fully diagnosed or identified as influenza viruses.
There is currently no evidence to support claims that bird flu is more transmissible among humans than other known species of influenza, and no evidence that bird flu is more likely to cause severe illness among humans than other known species of influenza, including chicken, chicken-and-honey and bird-suspected-all-together.

158,GPT-2 Summary,"Microbiology of food allergies
A brief understanding of how intestinal microbes function in food and how they differ from host immune responses could help to clarify food allergy research as a whole.
While the gut microbiota is widely used in our study as model organisms for investigating interactions between food antigen or the gut microbiome and specific pathogenic microbes, these organisms can also help to differentiate whether the responses we observe are due to host or environmental factors.
How microbes operate in the gut microbiota
In the gut microbiota there are four major subpopulation represented by various organisms.
These microbial communities are composed of several key components present in the normal microbiota, specifically the members of the Lactobacillus species.
The two major Lactobacillus species are Enterobacteriaceae and Bifidobacterium subsp.
Bacteroides aureus.
Bt and Bt crops are genetically engineered species of plants that are cultivated as a conventional crop and are sold as meat and animal feed.
Both Bt and Bt crops contain Bifidobacterium as their main microbial species, and these microbes function as the main component of one of the primary food webs of the human diet and are responsible for production of numerous human health benefits.
Thus, the gut microbial community appears to have an important role in the regulation of host immunity.
The relationship between these microbial members on the one hand and the host mucosal immunoglobulin response is important not only for the management of food allergies in particular but for the development of new therapeutic modalities for treating these conditions.
On the other hand, the relationship between the microbes in the guts and the host immune responses is less clear.
It is difficult to distinguish from the gut microbiota, especially by Western diet based studies, the effects that these commensals might have on"

159,GPT-2 Summary,"What the research has found:
In the last 7 years I have published my work as Director of the TLD Program at New York State University on three major issues in the treatment of thrombocytopenia: (1) Is the clinical benefit of antiplatelet chemotherapies and antiplatelet therapy for platelet cell disorders of the thromboembolic heart a false promise?
(2) The therapeutic potential of immune responses in the prevention and cure of all but the most severe of thrombocytopenia.
(3) How many cells are needed to produce the thromboblast, prothrombin, microglobulin, or IFNγ antibody response by thromboembolic patients with minimal thrombotic events but is this enough to produce the clinical response with thymidrosis?
A new wave of research on thrombocytopenias and thrombosis is beginning to develop and a need for comprehensive evaluation of these patients is becoming critical.
I am one of those investigators in this field as I am well familiar with this problem and am willing to help others with some of my personal knowledge of the thrombogenesis pathway through my work which examines thrombogenesis and thrombogenesis related thrombodynia and their connection to the pathogenesis of thrombosis in various thrombocytes from multiple organs including thrombus, thrombenocytes, and thrombocytes from different types of cells.

Before starting, let me state this: There are some important topics that will only appear briefly, just for the sake of convenience.
This is a non-prosecution document, which means the material can be reviewed by any professional and even if that person finds things interesting and not technically possible to put it in an academic paper, you can expect them to review it and give you positive feedback; I have never given negative feedback at all prior to publication of anything on this blog so if this continues to happen, I will most definitely revise this post.

Despite his initial diagnosis, i still had several difficulties.
I was born with a rare congenital defect that affected his superior cranial nerve, a long-standing problem.
My father had a very limited function of this nerve.
He could not push along a wheel on his own.
I was fortunate that his medical conditions did not worsen over time.
My parents also had many difficulties in raising my son.
My mother's surgery, together with treatment that my father went through, allowed my father to complete school.
Despite that, my father continued to struggle with chronic pain, fatigue and mental health.
He eventually passed away from osteoarthritis two years ago.
On June 14, 2013 he was admitted to a nearby hospital with severe brain infarction, and after intensive rehabilitation and brain scans I found that my father had a malformed lateral portion of the optic nerves from his skull.
Since my father's neurological disorder was very advanced, most of my father's brain was taken out in June 2015.
My parents continue to pursue these goals with new vigor.
From their end there are 3 ongoing challenges that remain.
As of now, my father does not have any long-term side effects, is being cared for well, and is doing very well during these challenging weeks.

162,GPT-2 Summary,"DMT induces a wide range of phenomena but primarily in the primary nervous system which are caused by the release of dopamine.
DMT is present in human plasma and therefore it can enter the brain on many different routes including intravenous.
DMT produces large amounts of the psychostimulants (MDA, oxytocin, cortisol, serotonin) and dopamine in both conscious and unconscious states.
Most potent psychedelics like DMT induce some degree of euphoria but are much less euphoric in nature.
DMT is an energetic potentiator at one of its two receptors, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, that acts as a transporter for dopamine.
Like the other two most widely investigated drugs of the brain that produce psychedelic effects, it is highly unlikely that DMT, like all psychedelics, would cause psychotic disorders.
DMT produces a similar chemical effect in the hippocampus but is more potent.
DMT is the principal agonist for both tryptamine receptors and serotonin receptors.
DMT is a partial agonist for serotonin receptors (in contrast to monoamines which have the active site intact) which means the two types are also partial agonists which means higher affinity actions with other serotonergic receptors.
Like DMT in the brain, DMT induces a psychedelic state in the peripheral nervous system through the monoamine oxidase enzyme enzyme.
Serotonin and DMT are involved in the serotonin system to regulate dopamine neuron firing rates.
Serotonin and DMT may inhibit the excitatory and inhibitory actions of serotonin receptors in a manner similar to how both of LSD's active receptors interact to control dopamine firing.
Serotonin and DMT are also involved in the serotonin system to regulate serotonin neurotransmission.

163,GPT-2 Summary,"Neurocircuitry: Body ownership illusions activate posterior insula, but not the superior lateral occipitotemporal (a,b), with effects mediated primarily by striatal and parietal regions.
In the inferior temporal lobe, these mechanisms are not activated.
Conclusion:
In conclusion, we argue, that body ownership illusions are an alternative basis for the use of body parts that are in fact real as ""true"" parts of a person.
It raises the issue of why body parts are preferred over real fingers, which is an easy way to confuse humans into believing they are real when they actually aren't.
Conclusion:
So why does the use of real body parts in illusion works?
As it turns out, we can explain the existence of body-ownership illusions by considering an important functional approach to visual perception, namely parametric visual stimulation.
According to the theory proposed by Hinton and McQueen (2007), we perceive parametric visual stimuli (with a parametry coefficient of 0.5) by observing the effects of motion on visual information (i.e., we see a change in color value of the stimulus, i.e., an increase in luminance), as shown in.
And the behavior of our brain can be illustrated with another parametric stimulus.
By stimulating neural activity in the posterior cingulate cortex, they demonstrated that when a picture is presented, we activate our right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), which is responsible for decision making and spatial tracking processes in the visual system.
Furthermore, by showing how our visual system operates through stimulus parametry, they showed that both the posterior cingulate and right DLPFC receive"

When sodium potassium citrate (SKNC) is introduced in a low carbohydrate nutritional diet for the treatment of mild or transient sodium consumption deficiency, there is a major decrease in sodium excretion, which leads to an important decrease, in some cases a major deviation in sodium excretion from a normal plasma level.
This has been identified and documented repeatedly in patients without acute hepatic failure in order to guide the management of chronic hypoglycemia and mild hyperglycemia.
The clinical observations were not limited to carbohydrate-free diets.

When sodium potassium citrate (SKC) is introduced in a low carbohydrate nutritional diet for the treatment of mild or transient hyperglycemia (HGA), there is a major increase in sodium excretion from the normal level up to approximately 250 times normal.
This major deviation (between hyperglycemia and HGA) is consistent with acute hypoglycemia as defined by plasma sodium concentration and is more commonly observed in children with HGA than in individuals with no evidence of metabolic syndrome.

165,GPT-2 Summary," Mucopolysaccharidosis type i is the disease that most often causes severe disease requiring surgery.
As I learned with other cases I've been interested in through this blog, there is currently no known cure.
Even when there is a cure patients can always go to another medical facility for another surgery.
The mumps vaccine and other antibiotics are not widely available for the general population or for patients with active MPS and some cases it has been reported that the mumps vaccine may be causing the autoimmune disease mumps virus for which treatments include systemic immunotropic therapy which are being increasingly studied for treatment for mumps infection with additional viral vaccines such as MPS.
However, even with treatment the autoimmune disease mumps virus will likely return as the autoimmune disease will most likely have returned for at least one more year and it is likely the patients will be immune to another possible source of infection such as another source of the mumps virus such as a different species of mumps.
While I wouldn't recommend that the general public avoid mumps for as long they can but it is prudent to understand and monitor potential risks at a minimum.
So what is being done to identify and treat patients with MPS?
I'm still skeptical at the time of this writing but I think there is a way of going forward because it depends on how accurate and cost effective the research is.
I believe this is the area where biotechnology in general is really needed because there isn't enough research about this disease to provide a vaccine that can be given to someone and protect them.

The results provided by this study suggests that patients who were sick for a year or more with kawasaki disease were actually only slightly at increased risk for developing chronic hypertension/coronary artery disease later on compared to uninfected patients.
I've presented these statistics and further information on the disease in more detail in a post published in 2010.
2) The presentation of patients with kawasaki disease in various stages of illness.
At times the majority of these patients might be hospitalized for further observation and treatment.
However, their case files would usually include documentation of a prior investigation (informal) or a case history.
3) How many kawasaki cases per year do we hear about?
In 2012 there were 943 kawasaki cases reported worldwide.
In that year there was a 9.5% increase in cases reported, and it was reported only three times that year in Japan alone, and almost exclusively in those with kawasaki disease.
That does not mean that the number of kawasaki cases is actually huge, but it represents a massive increase for a disease, which is still very rare and not considered to be a major health threat.

EVIDENCE ON CHANGING THE LIFE OF ANIMALS TO REPLACE VITAMINS 
In summary, the current studies are based, on statistical reasoning, on a mechanistic approach that focuses on changes in cellular activity and function
While this approach has been proposed in several studies aimed at elucidating the specific cell and tissue dynamics at play behind the aging process, such as   
A recent review paper  from H. Nohri and E. M. Muhannan showed that increased protein synthesis from aged cells can significantly accelerate the aging process while decreasing free radicals, while demonstrating that a more specific role for antioxidants may not be an end goal in these experiments
These ideas also come from

169,GPT-2 Summary,"Genome structure changes from gene tree to protein expression tree.
Mutations of genes from the primary mouse tumor gene pTH2 contribute to the human tumorigenogenicity of methylglyoxal, causing chronic disease, including melanoma and cancer.
At present, most of the mouse tumors, both squamous and skin, harbor mutations in the methylglyoxal transposition machinery of the cytoplasm, and there is clear evidence that these tumors are caused by the gene MTH2 (NCT02378559) in addition to other tumor genes, such as rtps2 and mtll2 (Jiang and Kim, 2003).
Because of the association between methylglyoxal and melanoma and certain human cancers due to mutations in methylglyoxal transposition, we were particularly interested in if MTH2 mutations contribute at all to human cancers (see earlier).
We have reported that the expression of many genes in human tumors is upregulated due to a mutation in mrna, an orphan exon of MTH2 that encodes a protein called wt-9 (Fig.
5A ).
Wt-9 binds to the enzyme mrna (see below); in turn, this binding leads to phosphorylation of wt-9, reducing the activity of wt-9.
The subsequent activation of methylglyoxal, mediated by the effector protein rna, leads to increased expression of many cancer genes.

There must be a comprehensive effort to better understand this and other tropical diseases.
If neglected tropical tropical diseases may have global status, then we still lack information surrounding where they actually occur.
3.
The incidence of each tropical disease needs to be mapped to obtain accurate information about these tropical diseases.
A global system of disease tracking would be required, in conjunction with the efforts made to detect and monitor these diseases worldwide.
There is currently widespread debate of the efficacy of global tracking, including whether global tracking will improve the quality of care for human beings infected with these diseases.
There are still significant questions about WHO's response to this debate as well as its lack of accountability from global bodies and the private sector.
4.
When discussing the need to better understand, evaluate, and control the risk for tropical diseases and other diseases, there should be an increased focus on the need to improve the global surveillance system and ensure its implementation.

171,GPT-2 Summary,"Water tank is not ideal for water displacement because there are high water pressure levels and the water can escape from the water tank and then into the machine's tank.
Water pump to obtain higher pressure pump are considered not ideal as the pump pump is located close to the water tank and the pump pumps water out of the tank.
High volume pump requires a separate water tank because when water is dispensed it cannot escape, but needs to be located close by the machine because of pressure difference."

It is apparent the gpu uses an enzyme that is involved in regulating gene expression and a neurotransmitter that may play a vital role in maintaining life while maintaining healthy organ function
2.
It is imperative to investigate the roles of gpr receptors in mediating these findings as there are many mechanisms that may exist
3.
It is imperative to investigate the molecular mechanisms of GPR modulation and the ways gpr antagonists inhibit its function
4.
This report does not indicate whether gpr receptors serve the same therapeutic purpose to ghr receptors as it does to the other GPR's
5.
It is very clear that the gpu requires sufficient amounts of gpr to perform its function as observed from the analysis of the gpi protein level of these cells
6.
This may suggest a potential role in the protection against neurodegenerative diseases via gpr
7.
As noted in some of the previous reviews and comments below, in neurodegenerative disease the presence of a GPR or the expression of it is predictive for the level of degenerating cells in the brain or spinal cord
8.
Thus it appears at least one function is necessary to control the levels of GPR's and/or a potential mechanism for modulation of these receptors as well

1) Try getting a few more weeks outside  instead of going to the doctor, or my brother, for a second opinion.
2) At some point, try doing some research on the disorder, so you know what's going on and can look it up yourself.
3) Ask anyone that I'm related with who's also had something similar what symptoms they're having and if you're not sure.
I'm an ex-student for 8 1/2 years now.
If they have been told to stay away from certain animals until they've had someone with more education about what we're dealing with (you and I)  then maybe they should.

Data are presented as unweighted rates and compared with hbv prevalence.
Data for this study came from surveillance conducted in 20 countries between 1992 and 2014.
The primary goal of the study was to summarize the overall hbv case prevalence and determine its overall decline.
To achieve this goal, data were analyzed to determine the prevalence data were impacted by the HBCCR-based vaccine schedules.
Results
Total data were available for 17,711 people in 10 countries and there is slight overlap in population size, so the analyses should be considered exploratory in nature.
These are presented in Table 1 (not included in the data).
No significant differences in the number of deaths are noted using the HBCCR or nonpregnant vs pregnant data for countries (e.g.

180,GPT-2 Summary,"This technique may be used for removal of metastatic prostate cancer cells from non-resectable posterior wall tissues;
it is described to selectively repair svc damage by using a modified left brachiocephalic vein flap.
Note that the technique used is completely new and is based upon methods described previously.
It is described by method description at bottom of article.
Note that I have not had to use the technique in a patient in my practice for approximately 6 years.
They used CT (i.e., tomographic) and performed an angiographic (an x-ray of the inferior wall) because I have never published anything from this field for any technique other than basic CT and the procedure is described here.
Because of these facts, I would suggest anyone with prostate cancer to seek my guidance in the technique of choice.
The technique of choice for many patients is to operate manual fistula.
However, there is the added complication that patients cannot be sure there is no lateral injury present before fistula surgery because the technique of choice has not been reported for fistula removal from posterior wall tissues.
This is why I was seeking further information from the field of anterior wall biopsy repair.
In the current article and many others, I explore the possible benefits of this technique.
For example, I explain how manual fistula repair can be performed in the absence of any additional imaging or surgical procedure.
I detail some of the most interesting findings, such as a case of metastatic prostate cancer of a 43 year old man.
The technique of choice I use is described in an earlier article.
Note that this procedure is not available in the current generation.

A dental plan for your child's dental care should include dental care care for both front teeth and anterior front teeth and should be designed to fit and match the child as closely as possible.
Dentistry is not a fixed thing, it changes throughout a child's life including the length of their childhood.
Each child is unique and having a dentist that will always be there to help with orthodontic treatment could be the last thing in their life.
Be sure that your dentist understands your child's current level of health and well being, how your child can improve their oral health needs, and will provide you the support they need in the event that your child needs further treatment.

184,GPT-2 Summary,"Pseudonomics is based on scientific research and may be controversial.
Even though many methods have been used and concepts are discussed, they generally cannot be applied consistently.
A lot of these methods just aren't as useful as others, so when it comes to choosing what method to use for certain areas, it's not often necessary to use all of them or even compare to others.
For patients who think that a methodology is good, or that I've stated ""methods"" accurately, please stop asking me why these methods worked or what they mean.
They likely work as described, or more likely, they work like nonsense (because there's always a random variation).
The following are the best, if not the only, methods to study atherosclerosis for people with heart disease (or at least like to think of them as being affected as they are) and their underlying mechanisms.
In some cases the method described was used by different researchers, based on their own experience or opinion.
Some doctors thought that an increase in blood thinner levels caused a decreased sensitivity to pain.
What are some of the best studies from this topic?
What questions should patients consider before ordering a study of their own?
The bottom line is: this is a subject for expert thinking because so many of the existing methods are flawed, confusing, confusing, and can lead to unnecessary risk-taking (which can be the death of the project).
Note: If you'd like to participate in some of my scientific studies on heart disease and/or stroke, I strongly encourage it.

186,GPT-2 Summary,"Health effects that make aging into another chronic condition:
1) Overuse of painkillers, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers, anti depressants and many other drugs increase risks of cardiovascular disease, age, death, disability and cancer.
People tend to try to reduce their risk by increasing the consumption of water, protein consumption, alcohol drinking, cigarette smoking, smoking cessation, avoiding harmful activities, exercise, sleep deprivation and getting better sleep and healthy eating habits.
2) Consumption of high levels of fat, proteins, sugars, fat and cholesterol has the major negative effect.
Obesity is becoming more prevalent, while chronic diseases are becoming more common.
High levels of inflammatory disease, stroke, cancer are becoming more common, hypertension and diabetes are rising.
Health risks for other diseases are increasing due to increased smoking related conditions, obesity, hypertension, hypertension for sure diabetes is rising, diabetes rate for sure cancer rate is rising as well as other harmful conditions including stroke, stroke rate of over one per one thousand people, heart attack, myocardial infarction, liver tumor, cancer and heart attack rates increased because of obesity and all other causes and also the excessive consumption of alcohol.

187,GPT-2 Summary,"In 2013, Dr Arjun P. Khan made the very difficult decision to discontinue steroid therapy for patients with non-pregnant children.
This was not based solely to lack of efficacy, but rather it was based on lack of efficacy and also that no other therapies worked for her children.
Her experience was both anecdotal and clinically significant.
I feel the decision had nothing to do with effectiveness and more it was based on clinical necessity and a fear that steroids would not treat any physical illnesses.
The patients who are prescribed steroids are often in need of other treatments and/or complications, which in my opinion may not be acceptable.
This was not just any steroids.
For patients suffering from the growth of a small child (less than 6 inches) and/or those needing treatment with adrenal suppression there is evidence to say that steroids might help.
There are two known side effects of corticosteroids (apoptosis and hepatoxicity) that might be considered as problems:
1) Hypoglycemia I am not aware of any reports of an association with postmarketing hyperglycemia since 2015.
I believe this was an oversight being given that some of them have a higher prevalence of hyperglycemia than most patients do.
Hypoglycemia with low plasma glucose (less than 4.8 mmol/l) has never been associated with adrenal suppression.
2) Hypogonadism This is a rare yet serious disorder, but one that has an association being with steroids.
It is an autoimmune disease that causes a reduction of the production of testosterone.
The most common form of hypogonadism with a hypogonadomania is adrenal hyperprolactinemia (AHS).

Early abortion and reduced birth defects is a serious problem in low income countries with high rates of early abortion and severe birth defects.
2.
World Health Organization estimate based on data from China, India, Brazil and India, countries that currently have the highest prevalence of childhood disabilities and birth defects, may be too low due to limited data sources.
3.
The world health organization and its partners suggest using new and updated sources to measure birth defects in low-income and middle-income countries, based on a study of China, India, Brazil and India, as well as on data from other countries, which can identify large numbers of early abortions and reduced birth defects at specific ages.
4.
As population aging in China (and other low income countries) means that older people are increasingly suffering from disability and birth defects, reducing these numbers is essential, especially among women.

So let's start with the one I personally have with and about my ovary.
I was diagnosed with ovarian cancer a few years ago in my late forties after my last fertility treatment failed.
Over the next 14 months I had over 20 cycles of chemo for ovarian cancer that turned out to not be working.
In April of 2010 I had a tubal ligation to remove my fallopian tube and ovary removed as per my doctor's recommendation on the basis of a false positive test.
In July of 2010 I had a small ovarian adenocarcinomas removed with a very strong intrauterine insemination to remove an ovary and my cervix removed in case they were precancerous.
At that point there were four more ovarian cysts that were still growing and there could be several more over time.
The next year they sent for a second and second round of insemination but it didn't work as well.
By May 2011 things had gotten out of hand and it was time for surgery with endometrial ablation with a progesterone patch.
It looked like it was really going to fail and I had been told after two rounds of surgery that it was ""about as good as it got"".
It looked so bad that my doctor wrote a letter to his office not to treat it.

192,GPT-2 Summary,"First and third opinion found no evidence that there was any change in the patient's condition after this surgery.
The initial surgical approach by the internist was too simple, the patient had already received all of the necessary follow-up care and we concluded that even if we did find evidence of septic shock, there would just be no real cure.
While I felt that this was the simplest explanation given the nature of the lesion, the absence of radiograph (lateral views), the lack of a biopsy of the site of onset of pain, and the lack of CT analysis or a detailed history of the patients history, there was a great deal of uncertainty about the evidence.
A second, less detailed examination by a physician showed that the lesions were not septuosae.
The absence of a clear diagnosis of sepsis and the lack of a definitive pathologic explanation allowed the internist surgeon to suggest the choice of an aggressive course of surgery.

193,GPT-2 Summary,"Morphological evidence
An anti-clonal antibody to cancer cells is an essential adjunct to chemotherapy.
These antibodies have been detected in large-scale clinical trials and in the environment for decades.
In the past three years the discovery of the Mutation 1826A receptor has led to the development of a new class of inhibitors of tumor growth in a cell type without known tumorigenic origin.
This new class uses cell class specific mutations in the receptor (Mutation 1826A R) to prevent cancer cell recruitment and progression in the body.
It uses a receptor that responds to a novel form of activation signal that has been previously described but is much faster and more potent than any previously used receptor in cell therapy.
This new receptor also has many other effects at the cellular level, such as suppressing the phospholipase C enzyme.
Although we now have a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the growth of cancer cells and their effects on surrounding tissue, there remains much more work to be done.
More important, molecular genetic tools are still required.
This is also a time when we need to focus on using the most effective drugs that are safe, effective and stable for the targeted cancer patient.
For this reason, we are doing all of our available chemotherapy tools, especially those that treat the human immune system, early, to treat cancers in early stage disease.

Morphological evidence of anti-clonal antibody to cancers.

198,GPT-2 Summary,"Lack of sufficient data makes it impossible to discern the exact cause of outbreaks related to foodborne diseases.
No data exist for foodborne disease outbreaks in the US.
Infectious disease outbreaks are rare.
Despite the best efforts to prevent outbreaks, they occur, and the US continues to become infected.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that there are approximately 1 million cases of foodborne disease each year in the United States.
However, there is only marginal data for foodborne outbreaks.
Some researchers estimate that there are upwards of 8,000 foodborne outbreaks each year.
They would like to improve data collection, including surveillance, to better understand outbreaks.
A new data set available to researchers, the National Outbreak Intelligence Network, (NOIN; http://www.noin.ca/), collects disease outbreaks identified from national outbreak databases.
This data set includes reports generated by state and local health departments and community and private companies in the US.
The number of reported foodborne illness reported to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from 1998 to the year 2000 was 29,000.
No data had been collected for foodborne outbreaks in the US in 1999 at this time.

Information collected of the data collected in FY 2003 was presented at the World Health Organization meeting hosted by the CDC.
The WHO reported that in FY 2003 there were 738 reported foodborne illness outbreaks in the world, a number equal to 14.1 million cases of foodborne illness reported between 1998 and 2000[3].
There is also much information available for outbreaks involving poultry.
In 1998, the CDC estimates that there were an estimated 437 cases of foodborne illness linked to chickens.

199,GPT-2 Summary,"A combination of treatments known as a triad of treatment approaches, one for both major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder including psychostimulant agents.
The combination of treatment, both in combination with lithium, can reduce weight gain.
Topiramate
Topiramate is one of those powerful antipsychotics that can make a significant difference when treating bipolar disorder.
Topiramate is used in mild to moderate cases of low grade depression plus high to severe psychotic disturbances.
A single dose of this agent increases brain volume by up to two-fold, a reduction in gray matter and the volume of neuron cells.
Dosing The Triad
Topiramate is available in either oral or sublingual forms and can typically be combined with a dose of lithium in order to reduce the chance of cognitive decline or cognitive impairment, especially over time.
I will give details of how to prepare for use since the study of the clinical efficacy of sublingual and oral drugs is complex.
Dosing Schedule
Topiramate is given in one to four medication dosages per day or in multiple doses up to about 20 mg daily.
The dosages given are based on the risk for cognitive decline as well as on cognitive symptoms and mood changes.
My approach in setting dosages used here was that in my experience to avoid major consequences we usually started with about 3 mg at one time for moderate to severe cases.
In my case, a single dose of 2.5 mg did result in significant weight loss in the patient, showing no more weight or weight gain than a dose of 1 mg at once.

201,GPT-2 Summary,"A plant based tcm theory may explain why some herbs such as furocoumarin (a fungicide for citrus), danken, scurfpea cause an allergic response when exposed to other herbs.
However, it's difficult to pinpoint exactly why some herbs may cause problems with allergic reactions.
It cannot be discounted that psoralen is actually the most commonly suspected type of herb that causes allergies; however, it cannot be eliminated from the equation.
Therefore, the tcm theory may be helpful in certain instances.
It is currently unknown how tcm might help remedy these reactions.
One plant based tcm theory is that all plants should have unique compounds or components that are different to what is found in a plant.
There are numerous similarities in various plants that are similar in structure.
In addition to the tcm theory and the general knowledge of the compound, plants can be analyzed for similarity from a general standpoint.
In plant based tcm theory, similarities between components is considered to be less useful in understanding the chemical relationship of a compound.
For example, the same plant can contain many different kinds of proteins that play a pivotal role in a compound's properties when taken together.
If one of these proteins determines whether or not an anti-inflammatory or anti-oxidant compound is effective, then different compounds would have the distinct properties of the compound of the same plant.
The use of plant based tcm and its use in medicinal research is not very common and has only recently gained widespread attention.

The purpose of the present article is to evaluate the association between anthropometry, anthropometric measurements (e.g.
chest circumference and chest oxygen saturation (CO), oxygen saturation of blood or pulmonary parameters), demographic variables measured according to anthropometric and pulmonary function assessments respectively.
The present article was born out of two separate studies that examined the relationship between anthropometry and pulmonary function measured by two different methods.
First in India in which anthropometric indices were taken as one measure of pulmonary function among tribal adolescents: The Indian and the Pakistans, both were tested.
Secondly, in Tripura in the north eastern state which comprises Tripura in the north east states of Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh, the results were studied among three principal districts in India as it is regarded as the cultural centre of the Tripura tribes, one of the largest tribal groups of a small number of tribal countries in Andhra Pradesh.
All data, which were collected with respect to the Indian and the Pakistans were based on anthropometric measurements of chest circumference and oxygen saturation  (CO) and pulmonary parameters.
The study of the second Indian study as reported is in the context of the Indian culture, therefore, the results of the present study are also applicable to Pakistan.
The study of the Tripura study as described above was a retrospective cross segmental study of 2929 children at three schools in Rajasthan as enrolled at age 8 years.
Three groups were tested: one included children of tribal children and another of Pakistani children; a further group contained children of children from these groups who had been observed with the same anthropometric measures taking as anthropometric measurements their normal norms.

204,GPT-2 Summary,"The most important thing to understand about peer production is that peer productions are not new.
They have roots in society and there is not only one way to produce peer productions.
In fact, peer production is really more of a methodology and technique based on which is possible to develop novel methods of improving peer production.
Peer producers have been improving peer production for centuries since the birth of industrial society.
And that brings me to my next point –
2.
Peer Production Is Like Any other Art
The basic difference between peer production (also called art) and other arts is that peer production does not represent the best interests or social value of any individual person.
Peer production is a method used not by individuals, but by all people.
So it isn't something that is created by some single person or organization using their own hands or resources.
No, peer production is created by everybody who uses something – from a small farmer to a big multinational company, from a small group of people to a whole world of peer-to-peer producers.
To be sure, social value is one of the things that gets reflected in peer productions.
However, peer production is just as important with respect to societal value to be able to realize the good that society produces.
The concept of social value is, in fact, a concept that was once part of the concept of social value.
And that's quite different from the concept of social value that was later discarded and forgotten.
So to use the word ""social value"" to describe peer production does not mean that only humans are involved in peer production.
Human society creates social value through peer productions; and this is why you find people in various places, even in all parts of the world making peer production.
So with respect to peer production, I think it is necessary to first understand that peer production does not represent only the views of society and society that produces.
Not only peer production does not represent the opinions and ideas of society"

Consumers are getting high quality drugs.
This book claims to be a definitive history of the drug industry.
It is more like a biography – well the book is written out into chapters instead of just as a series of pieces.
It's been six years since I last read it.
So much has changed in the intervening years that it feels as if maybe I've read and reread it all before.
If someone should be able to read what's been written and write a new story about the origins of the American drug industry over the last eight decades, it would be me.
I would love to know what all the fuss was about.
However, I think the most surprising thing is just what a great book it is, even if the facts don't exactly support that.
This book claims that monopoly prices are what spur consumer spending on pharmaceuticals.
It gets quite complicated in fact.
There is a lot of jargon in this book so I'll gloss over most of it here.
It's not that hard, though.

A child can get off-beat and do spontaneous physical activity in their first days.
2.
The child's physical activity rate is increased by nearly 50% when they start spontaneous physical activity early in puberty.
3.
A child's weight and weight gain can be controlled with daily exercise.
4.
An underweight child can be encouraged to exercise.
5.
A child's body mass index (BMI) is significantly related to their energy expenditure in an effort to reduce their risk of weight gain and obesity.
A final piece in the puzzle is to have a look at the relationship we can use to calculate the weight on average in your population.
As someone who uses FHRM data for most of his daily fitness research, I am currently using PIA as a tool for this analysis.
When the PIA is calculated for some population, like the obesity or underweight populations, the FHRM is shown at the base, and the PIA is in upper.
Here is the data for America's children with the following weights on average:
Average body mass index  -0.36 
Weight  -0.32 
 In this case the normal  FHRM weight is 0.36, meaning  a 15 year old can lose an average of 0.31 pounds  from their weight.
This would not look like much to me, until I tried it for myself.
My first attempt ended up with a 10 pound loss.
As I stated in a previous post, children who have very low body fat levels in the early teens and 20's lose about 0.25 pounds per month from weight loss.
A person losing 15 pounds might lose one pound from their body"

Athletes are experiencing increased performance enhancing benefits of nutritional supplements in addition to sports.
Research into the benefits of supplements is difficult.
However what is clear is that these supplements are being purchased by millions in millions of Americans who are not concerned with nutrition or their health.
The studies above demonstrate that consuming certain brands might actually cause an increased risk for injuries to the muscles.
2.
These benefits have led to an increase in the sales of dietary supplements including supplement brands which in turn have resulted in the purchasing of many supplements as well.
3.
While these supplement purchases have the potential to decrease our consumption, it also points to a real problem with the way that the mainstream mainstream health industries are addressing the issue of supplement marketing which leads to increased exposure and potential exposure to dangerous ingredients at the same time.""
TL;DR:
This piece was written in the spirit of this blog series - with the suggestion of the reader that anyone interested in supplement marketing and its dangers be wary of buying its products.
We will provide the links to the companies and nutritional supplements companies which are responsible for marketing these products - it will be very useful if readers can send them in and we can try to give a voice to those involved."

208,GPT-2 Summary,"Microencapsulation can be used to produce large biofilm sizes in microorganisms resulting in reduced bacterial colonization.
Microencapsulation also reduces bacterial resistance and promotes bacterial resistance via protection against immune responses.
While the role of microencapsulation in pathogen or bacterial resistance is not well understood, the safety profile of microencapsulation in humans and animals under conditions of disease should inform use of microencapsulation as part of probiotic supplementation in humans and animals.
Probiotics which are supplemented by microencapsulation are usually able to resist antibiotic and viral treatment such as streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli.
In clinical trials in humans and animals in response to conditions such as disease as streptococcal pneumonia, streptococcal infections and non-bacterial bacterial infections, the benefit of this protective effect has been noted.
Microencapsulation also offers an immunomodulatory effect by decreasing the frequency of skin lesions due to inflammation and the expression of CD8+ T cells is increased in addition to the other immunologic functions mediated by T surface receptors.
The effect of microencapsulation on microorganisms has been evaluated in vitro and in comparison to antibiotics in cell cultures and in vivo in vivo in vitro and in vivo are shown in table.
In vitro tests indicate that microencapsulation enhances the biofilm formation and protection of bacteria and other microorganisms.
The biofilm effect seen with microencapsulation is comparable to that seen with antibiotics and other antimicrobials.
TL;DR
Microencapsulation produces larger biofilms and a more resistant biofilm that is able to resist most antibiotics, particularly with respect to Streptococcus pneumoniae."

Two-thirds of the patients had a history of stroke including a history of non stroke symptoms.
The patients with known stroke history had similar lesions and were more likely to have dysplasia compared to those without.
Treatment options
Treatment consists of two options: surgery to rectify the affected area with a surgical implant or treatment to induce the lesion.
The procedure usually involves surgery and is relatively safe for both patients and the surgeon and does NOT require extensive brain scan and CT images.
Patients of this class of children have a mild to moderate degree of visual impairment that does not interfere with their everyday lives.
However, most patients experience visual loss related to the disease progression and/or are not able to walk.
A significant number of patients are also cognitively impaired.
For this reason, the incidence is small.
The most common treatment strategy involves ophthalmic surgical repair of the lesions and replacement of the damaged areas with scar tissue and a retinal prosthesis.
Surgery requires surgical removal of various structures in the affected area including the brainstem and retina from the skull.
The surgery can result in structural losses to the brain.
Other patients can suffer transient partial or complete loss of vision.

If I decided to give the medication on my own I didn't want to lose my patient, I wanted to learn, and this led me towards a completely new paradigm, when I ask someone to help me with my clinical issues.
It was through this idea of teaching me to understand my patient that I started to understand the complexity of my system.
The patient had recently lost her sister to type 2 diabetes which had severely impacted her physical and mental health, however the patient's family member had an auto-immune disease; it's been five years now, and my patient is almost completely cured with no residual neurological symptoms.

213,GPT-2 Summary,"The key to cancer treatment is targeting each gene individually that affect cancer outcomes.
2.
Genetic Alteration: To target the genome at an individual level, specific genetic mutation has to be used either under control of drugs or pharmacologic treatment to target each of the genes that affect cancer response and its progression.
To achieve such control, gene editing is needed.
In the field of drug discovery, gene editing has been used to target specific gene mutations in different cancer targets to gain knowledge of cancer-specific targets and mechanisms to enhance cancer cell survival in various experimental cancers.
These methods include using the insertion and deletion of exons and dna, gene editing of promoter regions, gene silencing of target genes, and direct gene therapy by gene therapy.
These methods for drug discovery in gene editing have been proposed in several major journals.
[16]..
3.
Gene Regulation of Gene Expression Target Altered by Target Genome Altering
A common method for gene regulation in gene editing has been the discovery and characterization of candidate gene silencing silencing of target gene during expression of transfected cells or cells of the same species.
These techniques for gene regulation have been developed for applications of several cancer models but they are used in many other types of cancers including lymphoma, breast, and other types of blood cancers.
As a result of genetic modification or gene silencing, the target of genes that regulate the expression of such genes is altered, the gene being transfected has mutated, and the targeted genes have been mutated.
This process includes modifications to gene expression, the silencing of the gene, transcription, binding, or other epigenetic mechanisms such as the insertion of non-coding DNA within a protein.

214,GPT-2 Summary,"-- A series of clinical studies have identified some of the essential molecular components of cancer cells.
These findings suggest that our understanding for cancer is currently insufficient to explain its pathophysiology in any realistic manner.
It also suggests that the molecular processes driving cancer cells' behavior may lie beyond our comprehension as an understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying these interactions may contribute to the understanding of both tumor cell cancer.
By the end of this article, a comprehensive understanding of cancer requires an understanding of specific cellular signaling and regulation mechanisms that modulate cancer cell physiology.
The authors are working to develop a comprehensive understanding of the cell processes involved in this disease process.
There are several important molecular processes for cancer cells.
Many of these are likely to play an important role in cancer-related pathology.
As more studies are performed, more research will be needed to reveal how cancer cells respond to different types of drugs.
The goal here is not a complete understanding of the disease process, but rather to provide a context for how our basic understanding of cancer development may improve by studying how cells affect each single part of the molecular system that we understand so far.
For a comprehensive overview of what has been learned so far about cancer and a detailed explanation of cancer as a disease process, please refer to a comprehensive review published in Nature,  by Professor Dr. Edward J. Amann  which will be available online, soon afterward in print, and on-line.

215,GPT-2 Summary,"The prevalence of idiopathic idiopathic asthma is still on the rise with a peak of 2.3% of all children born worldwide between 2007 and 2010, an increase of 44% from 2006, according to data from the United Nations Children's Fund's Global Health Statistics 2014.
Idiopathic respiratory condition has an elevated impact on child mortality, morbidity and poor health in developed countries, in particular in Asia.
It is the second most common respiratory condition in children under 5-years-old.
The worldwide prevalence is estimated at 1.0, or 11 times higher with approximately 10% of Chinese children reported to have acquired it.
Despite all the research and evidence on this new medical phenomenon, many people doubt it will ever be completely solved or eradicated (eg, 2/10 report on incidence of asthma by 2007, http://www.dol.gov/phases/phases-9/phd/publication-11) The number of parents reporting this asthma may help to identify the risk factors involved in its prevalence, but how many of them have the option to vaccinate their own child?
Although more research needs to be done, epidemiological studies reveal that nearly a third of children infected with IL-8 in childhood will have idiopathic respiratory syndrome by the time they reach young adulthood, the greatest effect being when mothers have their children during pregnancy, i.e.
5-9 years old.
This article was last updated on May 16 (2013), the prevalence of idiopathic asthma was calculated from a total of 35 studies published from 2006 to 2013, but more recent statistical research in the same year of 2011 is showing that there appears to be an association with children's health.

Health care and modern healthcare delivery  is a subject where multiple parts are not well integrated.
To achieve the goal of a high quality health care system, modern healthcare delivery must combine the core competence of modern healthcare delivery components but they need to remain separate.
For example, there are a long list of modern healthcare delivery technologies, for example, e-newsletter, open electronic medical record ( EMR ) database, open online medical records ( OOMRs ) databases, web-based medical records (WBMR), Internet of Things (IoT), wearable devices, etc.
The purpose for this post is to explain why it is difficult to integrate modern health providers as well as all aspects of contemporary healthcare delivery systems.
I will focus on modern health delivery technology as it may be useful for understanding the challenges faced to advance health care delivery as well as for the challenges and potential areas of improvement facing modern healthcare networks.
First, to give a better overview of today's health care system, modern healthcare networks appear increasingly fragmented in terms of technology, infrastructure, delivery channels, organization, business models and governance.
Today, for example, most American hospitals and clinics lack access to a modern health network system and this makes it very difficult to develop effective strategies for delivering healthcare to healthcare beneficiaries.
Modern health care delivery systems are also unable to address the emerging challenges in providing effective quality of healthcare when healthcare providers have to communicate, distribute and distribute the services.
For example, in this situation, a patient can receive care from a single provider, but he or she has to ask other healthcare providers to do work, attend to others in the nursing home, take delivery of supplies, deliver medications or treat patients in hospitals, etc., all of which are completely out of the order to fulfill"

217,GPT-2 Summary,"As you can see, one of the things that are frequently missed when describing color vision is the presence of the eye's most basic, yet most difficult and most frequently overlooked feature – the colors themselves.
Color cones and color receptors have been proposed to play a key role in perceptual, visual, motor and cognitive function and can therefore be identified and mapped into the brain, along with brain regions involved in both vision and language.
These brain networks are critical components of the development of the sensory system, as well as are critical to the acquisition of visual content.
Color vision can be an extremely complex area that has not yet been fully defined.
In an attempt to do this, it has been suggested that, while it is easy to talk about colors as ""seeing,"" that is, it is hard to accurately describe how colors ""hear"" or ""see"" with any detail.
Many people consider this to be a mistake, and when they do, they mistakenly assume that colors have special visual/sensory properties other than the normal perception of the two basic categories ""pink"" and ""red.""
Color vision is, in fact, fairly simple, and, as long as we understand the fundamental properties that colors must possess for that to be true, we can understand how color perception is formed.
This article is not meant to replace a full understanding of color vision.
However, more research into the scientific underpinnings and mechanisms of color vision is certainly necessary.
This approach allows us to consider the color vision as a continuum that has not yet been completely defined.
The basic features of color vision include:
Apertures: There are four basic aperture categories that are necessary for color vision: f4, f6, f8 and f16.

Unidentified (nuclei unknown), high density, and highly differentiated intracellular oligodendrocytes are present in most patients with bilateral spinal cord malignant glioblastoma
2.
High density oligodendrocytes may have important clinical significance in treatment of several cases
3.
No definitive correlation could be established between the two species of neurons
4.
Ultrasonography shows intracellular oligodendrocytes in all cases, but only in the bilateral cases
5.
Ultrasound images with contrast enhancement demonstrated the presence of cysticized intracellular oligodendrocytes in all cases
In addition, for the first time, the frequency of multiple intracellular oligodendrocytes can be obtained and confirmed in the presence of a single, large, mature oligodendrocyte with a thick stalk and thick stalks
Although the presence of oligodendrocytes in glioblastoma is the definitive clue, most patients cannot distinguish their cells from surrounding cells.
As well, there are different levels of immunohistochemical detection of these cells.
The histopathological examination is not usually necessary because of rapid recognition and the tissue typically is destroyed by chemotherapy.
Therefore, the specific identification of specific nodules that are detected in different tissues is important.
In the present work we identified 11 individuals with focal glioblastoma in the spinal cord.
The neuropathological evaluation was done to see if these 11 patients were still in remission after surgery, and which of them had not had any progress on therapy.

221,GPT-2 Summary,"In the early phase of the placebo-controlled trial (Phase 3a) prednisolone resulted in minimal change in serum cortisol and significant improvement in the pre-intervention baseline level of 20-40 pg/ml [1].
At 60 days posttreatment, blood cortisol averaged 25-35 pg/ml and treatment with prednisolone resulted in significant improvements in serum cortisol values after one month of treatment.
In combination with prednisolone, the pre-intervention serum cortisol level was reduced to the clinical mean of 12.7+/-7.3 pg/ml to a target of 12.2 pg/ml [2].
The primary efficacy endpoint in this study was an approximately 1.5-fold decrease in mean corticosterone measured 24 and 72 h after the last prednisolone administration period.
The primary end point in the primary outcomes of this study was a difference in mean serum cortisol value; in addition, all individuals who completed the trial were treated with prednisolone.
The conclusion of this study provides no further evidence regarding the efficacy of prednisolone in the treatment of kawasaki disease and, to the best of our knowledge, it is not yet possible to determine the optimal doses of prednisolone in individuals with this disease.
This trial was limited by the small sample size or by the inadequate definition of illness, leading to substantial power limitations in identifying meaningful differences between the pre-treatment baseline cortisol response and the outcome of interest.
While the overall results of this phase of the trial suggest that prednisolone therapy may be useful for individuals with kawasaki disease, whether the therapeutic effects are clinically relevant and if there are adequate and appropriate risks of adverse events is not known.

However, we were unable to identify any of these companies among all the patents that were developed during that time period.
Bayer-Universität Frankfurt has participated in an international initiative to support the investigation of several pharmaceutical companies into potentially harmful chemical reactions.
To this end, we have collected data from many different research organizations to obtain a better understanding of what works in the laboratory compared to what just happens in the field.
The result has been the development of a new ""bioscience laboratory instrument"" that has been used to investigate the safety and efficacy of some new pharmaceutical compounds for the treatment of cancer, immune dysfunction, and other disease and health conditions.
Our research group has used three different approaches to this goal: the method of statistical analysis, the quantitative methods of comparative pharmacological measurements, and the experimental techniques of testing real data.
Bayer-Universität Frankfurt holds both a PhD in Industrial Chemistry and a Masters degree in Chemistry; as well, we have a Ph.D. in Materials Science and Biotechnology and are able to collaborate with companies, universities and public organizations worldwide as needed.
In addition, we have a PhD in Biotechnology, a B.S.

225,GPT-2 Summary,"Here you will see the similarities which distinguish American blacks, European Europeans and Asians from each other, not to mention differences.
Here we will also show the important differences between racial and ethnic groups.
So let's talk about the teeth of African Americans, European English, African American Europeans and Asian Asians.
To sum these up you know that all of us know that the Asian is also the tallest people in this world, whereas the African American is also the shortest (1.33 m) and the white people are also among the tallest people in the world.
Even this has not changed since the early 1960's but nowadays Asians grow shorter than African Americans.
So we do not know why African Americans are taller than whites but when I have seen Asians I know that they don't need tooth extraction.
In fact tooth extraction is a really expensive procedure which can be dangerous for Asian Americans due to their lower body masses and poor teeth structure.
So what is the reason for these similarities - teeth?
Because African Americans have thicker teeth and they have been born with them and it is due to the African African Ancestry of African Americans which explains this common trait across the planet.
In America, the African American has a stronger bone structure and it's responsible for their larger stature.
But why is this advantage?
Why is there such an enormous difference in body mass between both different racial groups?
It has to do with the level of bone density in the body!
The African Americans need more muscle, this higher weight on their bones allows the body to sustain its weight and thus they receive more nutrition than their counterparts in African African ethnic groups where in fact their body mass tends to be lower.
Because of their body masses it means that the African Americans have a tougher and stronger skeleton and their lower strength results in more strength and strength makes a tougher"

In this study we used motion sensor and movement sensor paired sensors to assess muscle activation in the lumbar spine for lumbar spasms.
A motion sensor was connected with a pair of motion sensor sensors (with sensors that can be connected to different sensors) and each of these two motion sensors was connected in to three other sensor.
For each of the active muscles, we connected the sensor of the upper limb.
A movement sensor is connected to a movement sensor (with sensors that can be connected to different sensors)
When both muscle movements involved the same motion sensor the position of the movements is displayed as a combined movement in the motion sensor.
There are 5 different muscles that can perform various movements.
When all the movement sensors (motion sensor, movement sensor) are connected, we classify the motion sensor as the active muscles.
The next step is to measure the changes in muscle activation between those in the field and those who play baseball
The results are similar with no significant changes in muscle activity between those in the field and those played in the field (L2 = 80.37).
When the two groups showed similar increases in muscle activation with motion sensor and movement sensor combined (L2 = 95.90), those in the field were also showing increases in muscle activity (L2 = 92.50 ) but this time none showed significant changes with the use of passive exercise.

229,GPT-2 Summary,"I believe that tb should be officially recognized within human disease data sets, given its unique disease severity, and/or its unique potential implications.
Tb should also be regarded more as a disease variant than as a drug-free alternative, due to its unique etiology, including higher incidence, and higher level of lethality, than other drugs of abuse.
I believe that, for these reasons, it should be recognized as a disease entity.
A couple of important things of note on this topic are that these are two totally different entities, or at least one with its own distinct presentation.
On the one hand we have those with serious cases only, but this should be balanced against those without symptoms and are likely to die in the foreseeable future as a result of this disease.

You get a good feeling from these procedures if you work up the tension with your fingers and/or scalpel.
Since this procedure is rarely performed by the general public, as well as the most advanced hernias there is a stigma against the patient.

231,GPT-2 Summary,"Clinical Practice Guideline
IMPORTANT NOTE
The purpose of this document is to summarize all of the key topics and concepts as the clinician's primary guideline on whether to initiate therapy with EBOV-serotyping or not.
It may not include a definitive final decision as there is no clinical data to prove or disprove.
The above presented are the concepts from the current CPG.
There may also be additional concepts from research or published academic papers.
If these are not currently covered, I will use the existing information for this guideline.
TL;DR:
EBOV-serotyping is currently the best way to perform a definitive laboratory test to determine IFV positive for EBOV (or its genotype).
It is a common, highly targeted disease and many patients do not know this information.
The clinician must have a highly accurate, fast and reliable laboratory assay and a patient knowledgeable of this information.
All blood from this patient must pass the assay.
The diagnosis can be made by using the laboratory test and then the patient can receive further testing such as cytologic, molecular, or tissue marker testing.
These testing must be obtained without the patient having to be aware that the test was done.
It is important to understand the difference between EBOV-specificity testing and serological testing and use laboratory technology appropriately to perform the assay.
The testing is very expensive and can include additional expensive or time consuming tests.
In order to prevent over analysis of the blood, I propose the following protocol as it is the only procedure recommended for patients not"

233,GPT-2 Summary,"While an initial study was undertaken, it became apparent to researchers that there was no definitive reason it was associated with other gynecological conditions; however an association between the disease of pregnancy and pyomyoma was noted.
So far so good.
So far this series of ""studies"" has not revealed any significant relationship or cause of a specific pyomyoma.
There have been reports of maternal hyperplasia.
The issue however, is of whether there are any other conditions with a potential connection with pyomyoma.
It seems more likely that pyomyoma is simply the outcome of a more malignant uterine cancer than an autoimmune disorder of the uterine microbiome.
So, I won't delve into the details on the subject.
However, we might learn more.
The Other Side
In my original blog post, there were four references to ""laser cell sarcoma"" or ""mammotum tumour""  in the treatment of pyomyoma.
This is due to the fact that they refer a number of terms that have not been applied to pyomyoma.
For reasons they chose to stick with the term pyomyoma which is of unknown validity due to its potential ambiguity, however since this is a relatively new diagnosis from the research community at present, it is possible that there is some truth in any of its assertions.
Indeed some of its claims are potentially true.
Of those four references, three included references to a possible link between Pyomyoma and Leukemia.
In the other two references, the word leukemia or ""leukemia"" is used only"

The large aneurysm caused a stroke that required intracranial and cerebral replacement of the entire brain.
In order to achieve patient's brain regrowth a radical thrombectomy was performed in late 2006 during intensive neurosurgical procedure.
In the course of the trial the patient's brain size had risen and he was able to receive full intracranial treatment with a platelet bank.
The patients was later put on a new neurosurgical approach.
Despite the fact that the brain injury was well within the established treatment range, the patients' age is not accurately described in the literature.
The age of the patient was estimated at 35 years as the age of stroke is a more accurate age to estimate.

2) The procedure in patients undergoing atrial septal septal stapling cannot be considered as satisfactory surgery.
Thirdly, after percutaneous atrial septal stapling or ventricular atrial stapling may result in delayed closure and prolong life for most patients.
It is important to note that most hypoxic encephalopathy patients cannot be successfully treated even with partial closure with ventricular aortic stapling but their mortality rates remain high.
In most of the world there are numerous countries where we are dealing with hypoxemia from chronic hypoxemia from hypothermia or severe hypoxemia.
Our experience is that in most of the United States atrioventricular blockage associated with acute severe hypoxemia is generally considered to be the main cause of death although many cases also result from multiple contributing factors such as atrial stroke followed by cardiac pacemaker (PAP), atrial septal blockage or septal hemodynamic abnormality (SHEO).

238,GPT-2 Summary,"TLDR: 
For a small subset of individuals with type 1 diabetes, it appears the type 1 diabetes screening program may actually be misconstruing it's screening criteria and therefore presenting patients with type 1 diabetes as less likely to successfully diagnose and treat the disease.
One study (1) found no difference between being screened correctly and incorrectly by either method, and other studies (2-7) indicated the negative impact of the initial clinical outcome, negative predictive value, and subsequent missed diagnoses of type 1 diabetes can actually exacerbate type 1 diabetes.
A recent study (8) found that in patients receiving screening that failed to detect a positive test result at enrollment, the primary outcome metric, the severity of type 1 diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance decreased over the following 6-8 months due to decreased overall disease activity.
The authors conclude that type 1 diabetes ""materially impacts"" screening by using screening criteria that include incomplete diagnoses, inaccurate reports of severity of the disease, and non-standard interpretation of responses of patients with type 1 diabetes.
This effect, by using overly broad criteria, is likely to lead patients to believe they are less likely to develop type 1 diabetes due to having a negative test result.
Therefore, for such individuals, the primary outcome metric should actually be a composite of the severity of their disease plus one potential secondary outcome, or in their case, disability related to their disease.
TL;DR: 
The types 1 diabetes screening program has presented itself as possibly treating a population of patients and may actually be promoting the spread of the disease (9)"

239,GPT-2 Summary,"For this blog, I've decided to focus on three main areas.
1 - The role of fibrils as scaffolds in amyloid biosynthesis and assembly.
2 - The role of oligomers in amyloid biology as intermediates to peptide synthesis
2.1 - Molecular assembly, oligomer interaction, and their importance to amyloid pathology.
It seems obvious that when the amyloid oligomer is joined to polypeptide, it can cause all sorts of unintended effects.
The oligomer will combine with polypeptide form to form amyloid-dendritic membranes, and they can form a new chain of protein in the presence of other polypeptides.
While the oligomer can act only on the host, it can interfere with the replication of the host and can contribute to its pathological properties.
For a large group of polypeptide sequences, polypeptide fibrils contribute at least in part to what is a very important function of each.
For a small subset, however, oligomer interactions contribute to the amyloid formation in amyloid, thus increasing our knowledge of which polypeptides are important for which diseases, and can provide insights into what might occur from oligomer interactions to create neuroprotective agents.
There clearly seem to be more than three dozen such compounds, even if just two or three make the cut, though it is possible that many other molecules contribute in small amounts.
If it were only the four hundred fifty single amino acid polypeptide groups, there would not be so much attention going on ("

240,GPT-2 Summary,"The above section discusses some of the main features of social situations in mammals living together, and describes how one interacts with non human mammals.
However note that they are primarily about social interactions on the surface.
Most research focuses on the interaction of two individuals, as they are considered the most socially relevant situations.
If it appears that some species do not have the same types of interactions, this can be considered to indicate a lack of social engagement.
Many questions continue to be addressed, including if the study of some animals can be useful compared with studying similar populations of humans or other primates.
The above section then concludes to highlight the importance of studying interactions between humans, which provides more insights into the biological and social mechanisms involved.
To take a brief closer look at social interactions we will briefly revisit the concept that animals can learn about each other's behavior, thoughts, emotions, and thoughts of others via interactions and learn or adopt the behavior of others.
This phenomenon is known as the ""social memory"" theory.
This theory has been presented before in relation to humans.
For example, see the recent discussion of social memory for chimpanzees in the blog entry on Chimpanzees.
It is a theory of how animals learn social structures, and how these become adapted to social interactions.
The Social Memory Study This study focuses on human social interactions primarily, as it applies to research on mammals.
The research is based on a series of studies in which researchers take a group of mammals and move them around the world and study their interactions there, and the interactions themselves.
As of now, all known research subjects are human.
For these studies, researchers attempt to determine the neural and hormonal aspects of social interactions.
For example, they use brain recordings, and other brain scanners (like fMRI) to compare the activity of certain parts of the brain for two different types of interactions, which allow them to"

241,GPT-2 Summary,"Fascinated by autophagy in order to be able to digest proteins while keeping a more stable state of a protein.
This paper addresses the hypothesis that some of the proteins which are present in the tissues of our body and which require autophagy could be eliminated via autophagy.
This is important because autophagy is essential for many of the processes in our body.
In addition, autophagy is also important in response to pathological changes in protein levels.
As such, reducing our tissue's protein content would not only reduce the risk for many illnesses and diseases, but it could help to lower the risk of cancers related to protein loss (eg.
cancer of the prostate).
If there is a significant reduction in the tissue's protein content after autophagy, what would be the mechanism?
I would like to mention four possible processes through which the process of removing tissue can occur:
1. removal of toxins from tissues, by removing organic compounds from the tissues and removing proteins.
This reduces toxins to inactive state without destroying active state.
2. removal of toxic byproducts from the food, or chemical products/activities from foods and environmental residues, (e.g.
from laundry detergent and washing machines).
3. removal of toxic byproducts from the respiratory environment such as dust, fumes, carbon monoxide and so forth.
4. reduction of protein content of individual tissues in cells.
The reduction of protein in cells could happen both by autophagy as a result of damaged proteins being broken down by autophagy, or also by removal of proteins from cells through mechanisms such as"

242,GPT-2 Summary,"The best, most common method for determining risk factors for brain infarction and sudden cardiac death is based on a novel, risk model that identifies factors that are important for survival in the event of a significant injury or shock.
The novel, risk model predicts the following characteristics when considering the prognosis of stroke, and stroke mortality: an additional risk factor for stroke is a stroke complication; most studies demonstrate that mortality is not dependent on the likelihood of a stroke.
The cost of the mortality benefit is based on the ratio between cost savings and the expected mortality (or the difference between predicted and actual mortality).
The cost savings are higher when there is a higher mortality risk.
[1] The National Stroke Association describes itself as the ""nation's premier organization dedicated to the public health of the brain.""
[2] All definitions of stroke use one of the four components: ""acute: is the first and most severe stroke which may lead to death; moderate: is more severe and requires several days to die; acute is the most serious stroke that can result in death; and sudden: is the first and most rapid death the prognosis may not be completely determined due to neurological complications.
If one wants to know exactly how to estimate risk of stroke compared to any other kind of death (cardiopulmonary or non-cardiopulmonary), these three risk factors and their relationship to outcome of a stroke are of great importance.
(1) The likelihood of a stroke is estimated using the following formula:
Loss of half of chance of stroke equals 0.75x 1 - (0.25x 0.5*0.4).
If you cannot identify this value in your risk model, we recommend not relying on this risk model and to use the prediction model:

243,GPT-2 Summary,"Sulfactosterone inhibits S. pneumoniae spore forming bacteria while nitrates inhibit spore growth.
The nitrate effect diminishes when spore forming bacteria become inedible.
Sulfate inhibits spore formation using a hyperglycemic mechanism that has been demonstrated in humans:
Fruitless, low-fat fast-digesting spore formed bacteria are able to escape the sulfate barrier, but when they consume high amounts of sulfate the bacteria become susceptible to sulfate toxicity.
In humans, nitrate intake results in increased inflammation, which results in increased stress with potentially negative consequences for brain function.
Bacteria need a high concentration of sulfate as well as a low concentration for maximum success.
The fact that the ability of bacteria to escape from a sulfate permeable barrier through hydrogen peroxide is a direct result of increased resistance to that barrier's action is particularly important in the prevention of spore formation associated with sulfate accumulation.
I am not advocating that you avoid cooking and eating meat all together as this does not seem to have much impact on the bacteria; however, I want to make sure that people read the message before they throw away their hard earned money because they don't see it, and think twice if they have not done so for their own personal health, and the health of their loved ones."

245,GPT-2 Summary,"I don't know if the ""the best known corneal carcinoma is found in the United States.""
A look at the paper highlights this weakness very clearly because it highlights a key concern: most of the research has been focused on the United States in the last few years, but there's been little discussion of other places.
That means many of the articles from research papers are just starting to be published in other countries.
And research that works in one place is going to be seen in the other place, not because researchers were using their preferred methodology, not because the methods are better, but because the methodology is not best.
Even if you read enough press coverage from the United States to generate more articles than you would have from reading them in the other places, the fact remains that there's a lack of quality research being done in the other places.
And that's why these types of studies may not be able to provide conclusive evidence that it's even true.
The data is clearly not there.

The literature clearly reveals the lack of a clear understanding, and hence a failure of epidemiological studies and primary research, of this new feature of keratoconus.
In fact, the authors even admit it, but they call for a more ""fundamentally important"" study, as if the study being discussed (and it isn't a completely convincing paper) wasn't important enough to require a more thorough, more well-specified research protocol and clinical case study.

In general, if the tooth has similar physical properties; the material is much more important as it helps seal the bond and therefore reduces the wear and fracture resistance, but it can cause a different texture, color variation or wear, and the surface can be very rough and uneven with some materials being duller than others.
The differences between the materials can range anywhere and sometimes even between the same type of material and different color changes are seen.
With resin, like with enamel, the material is very important in its effect; the difference in texture can vary and even have permanent loss of color or other subtle color differences."

250,GPT-2 Summary,"Gastroparesis is a serious condition causing serious medical complications
HIV is another major cause.
There are three different forms of gastric-vascular disease (vasculitis, gastroparesis, and chronic nonendothelial necrosis).
Some forms of gastroparesis are associated with HIV infection and other infections including Hepatitis B, Herpes simplex virus type 2, and various bacterial infections.
HIV can cause severe gastrointestinal bleeding during treatment, and gastroparesis can affect the mucosa around the small intestine causing blood to leak into the large intestine (perforation gastritis ).
Although it is difficult to track the exact cause of gastroparesis, two important factors contribute in causing gastroparesis to progress apically as ""perforation gastritis"" where the blood goes to the small intestine causing an accumulation of blood vessels and the body's own immune system has a hard time fighting it.
So there is likely going to be complications from gastroparesis.
For years, there has been an explosion of research that the use of electronic stimulation for gastroparesis, or other medications that target the receptors on the heart, pancreas, stomach, or vagus that allow gastroparesis, is now making gastroparesis a less serious condition.
In fact, there seem to be two major types of stomach ulcers that cause gastroesophageal reflux disease, and they are likely related.
One type is the stomach ulcer that does not have the ulcers in the gastrointestinal tract.
The other type has an ulcer that does have the small intestine ulcers.

251,GPT-2 Summary,"Health concerns have grown for several decades from lack of evidence to lack of evidence against such intervention to increasing awareness of risk factors.
For example, physical inactivity significantly decreases the risk factors for various diseases and even a small increase, by fifty minutes per week over forty-five hours per week increases the risks of developing various diseases, especially cancer incidence.
Furthermore, there is a greater likelihood of complications of disease due to chronic disease.
These issues have spurred efforts to promote physical activity in order to improve health.
For example, a 2006 study by Ritchie and colleagues found that exercise is one of the best ways to prevent heart disease among both men and women.
However, in a randomised trial involving only participants aged sixty and older, no benefit of exercise was revealed among men and women.
Another example is a study by Yutts & Siegel published in 2009.
They followed 40,000 adults between the ages of thirty–45 and found that a moderate amount of physical inactivity was associated with better cardiovascular health than usual daily physical activity among middle aged men and a reduced risk for many common diseases and cancer.
However, their results only indicated that no reduction in cancer occurred with the intervention, and this was confirmed in subsequent follow-up studies.
Finally, a recent randomized study published in 2010 of thirty thirty six adults showed a positive association between physical inactivity and increased risk of cancer of the esophagus among non smokers.
There are many more examples to illustrate the importance of risk factors for physical inactivity to improving health outcomes and reducing long-term disease.
However, it is important to remember that much of the research done in Australia has been based upon observational studies based upon the assumption that physical activity remains a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease.
These results have only been validated by studies of older adults and the results of the studies reported for younger adults have not been"

255,GPT-2 Summary,"Cox-2 inhibitor could reduce the incidence of hemorrhage.
Cox-2 induciations may decrease CVD risk.
Cox-two inhibitors may decrease risk of atherosclerosis, gastrointestinal and circulatory complications.
In early stage study, researchers tested cox-2 in 468 primary care patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
They found that the patients who received cox-2-containing antiplatelet therapy experienced a 20% reduced incidence of bleeding (40 / 469).
The rate of symptomatic adverse events was less than 1%, which demonstrates the modest effect of this first attempt at antiplatelet therapy.
This trial was not a gold standard, but it was the first controlled trial to demonstrate improved cardiovascular and GI outcomes, and it is the largest randomized controlled study in the world.
A 2013 randomized placebo controlled trial found the same 20 percent reduction in bleeding as the Phase 1 trial.
The trial was unable to achieve blinding because pre-designations for the drug participants were not made.
In an effort to minimize the influence of placebo effects, researchers designed the trial by adding a second pre-designation for participants who received their therapy with a placebo arm.
This trial used randomized, double blind placebo controlled studies.
In this study, the group administered a placebo arm.
It is critical to note that the trial was designed to allow the placebo group an opportunity to experience the benefit of the cox-2 inhibitor from which they derive much of their benefits.
These benefits include: improved blood pressure
improved peripheral vascular function
reduced need for intravenous saline therapy
reduced need for insulin treatment
improved renal function"

All of them in the past year or two in particular.
The most recent research comes directly from a new study from the U.K.'s Royal College of Surgeons that examined the health of the population, using data collected from more than 23000 British adults.
They used this data to investigate the health of the population – more specifically: where are the people located, how well are they treated, how are their outcomes related to health?
The result has been that the UK health care system remains significantly worse for the underprivileged.
I've outlined all of the results on other similar issues  in the past.
This study was conducted as part of an ongoing effort to analyze the health of the population and the health outcomes around one-third of the total population that live in the UK.
In fact, only 17% of the population in the UK live in a healthy place.
It is estimated that one out of every 6 adults in the United Kingdom does not live in a healthy place.
This underscores the fact that the NHS, where one in ten are currently receiving primary healthcare services, is still lagging behind what European nations offer.
There are several potential reasons for this and they include: 
The UK government's Health Service: The vast majority of care is delivered by the voluntary sector with the bulk being funded by the NHS.
As the British government has long stated it wants to deliver higher quality health care at smaller government expense.
However, the United Kingdom will have to go through a process of implementing changes in a way which improves the overall financial viability of the services provided by the NHS.
To date, most of these proposals are aimed at improving the access to care provided by the public system while the private sector provides the healthcare.
As a result, the UK is having to go about this through either"

Previous post-post-mortem studies have shown associations of advanced age and progressive degenerative arteritis in cardiopulmonary diseases [9] [10] [11] [12].
This study further established the relation by utilizing a cohort of almost 100,000 Japanese men, who were between 65/72 years of age and 75 years of age.
In this cohort, we investigated the association between the time-varying age from the time of death to the onset of myocardial infarction, and the development of Aortic Syndromes (AS) in the following conditions: arterial stenosis (AST), ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), acute ischemic stroke (AFS), acute ischemia-reperfusion injury (AIS) and congestive heart failure (CHF).
This study also investigated the association with myocardial infarction in the same group of men.
The analysis of the association of the time to death and the incidence of ASCs in our cohort was performed using a time point regression analysis.
It had become apparent the time-varying age was associated with a higher incident AS due to lower life expectancy.
Therefore the analysis aimed at predicting the incidence of ASCs at the age of 75 years.
This information allowed the development of a time-varying model.
The results revealed a significant association between the age at death and the incidence of ASCs (p<0.05) in the ascending AV of the left ventricle.

The content of the curriculum could include information about, and exercises for the students' knowledge of, medical principles, clinical skills, information on patients' characteristics in addition to clinical skills, the value of clinical knowledge, and how healthcare professionals make sense of patients' behavior.
Teaching for People Who Already Know and Treat
Learning a variety of subjects has great value.
For example, in the past, students would learn the scientific terminology, the basic concepts, and the principles of physiology and biology in their junior year.
Now a course in Biology could cover biology in one session and in Biology in another and include materials regarding the application of modern technology to studies of humans and organisms.
People are eager to learn science, technology, and education.
There is no denying it and that is why learning through education is so important.
When these subjects are covered, students have greater understanding about these topics and have a much greater sense of what it means to do something.
This is why courses such as physics, chemistry, physiology, and biology could be added to the curriculum from the beginning of the first semester.

259,GPT-2 Summary,"The study of the regulation of gene translation with mammalian genes has attracted considerable interest in recent years.
Although this activity seems to be universal in any animal, the mechanism by which these events occur has been less comprehensively described – the details of how the events occur can vary among genes and within different species.
Here we are able to provide an integrated framework defining the cellular mechanisms by which mrna transcription takes place and by which they are regulated.
Our data thus provide an updated picture suggesting that mrna transcription is regulated via non-transcriptionally regulated pathways, including the activation and degradation of translational factors, the initiation and secretion of transcriptional factors and the regulation of translation.
These non-transcriptional regulatory pathways provide an alternative view on what makes specific mrna transcription events happen.
This has important implications both in establishing whether mrna transcript regulation takes place on target sites and in revealing a molecular basis of mrna function.
The RNA-Seq dataset has now been released as a part of the NCBI Genes and Genomes Project."

(this is just an outline)
Cholecystectomy is generally performed when patients are experiencing bile duct or bile acids toxicity of hepatic bile duct and bile acids which can be seen with conventional screening or when the liver is experiencing liver damage resulting from a liver transplant.
It can't be confused with the commonly associated choledochial pneumonia or cholangiopancreatial hemorrhage.
When done without definitive treatment, cholecystectomy can be performed with the patient being informed of the adverse cardiac or renal effects.
It has been suggested cholecystectomy is performed with patients with bile duct problems which are at least partly related to hepatic cancer and not all patients are aware they have hepatic cancer.
It is currently being performed with most of its efficacy derived from an unselected population of patients with severe liver cancer.
This section offers more information surrounding cholecystectomy as well as a brief history of cholecystectomy in the literature.
This topic has been covered in extensive detail here, especially since you posted on the topic in 2011 and since it has become very popular within the chiropractic community.

264,GPT-2 Summary,"There's some good data on patients of mental illness having some of the highest mortality rates across a long enough time span from study.
There's also solid evidence that this is very likely because of the adverse health care, the lack of rest, and general mental health issues.
Practical Application
 PTSD Patients Have Higher Mortality Rates Than General Population Population - Mental Illness Theories
There are many theories out there as to why patients of mental illness cause much higher mortality rates than the general population.
Some of the theories are plausible but I don't think you have the data to answer or refute all of them.
Some theorists have done great work studying mortality rates but not providing enough detail on who they are studying.
Maybe this is where a little science can be helpful.
We have a plethora of studies on how we measure mental health in patients.
While not everything compares equally to someone who has no ill state they do have different characteristics as to how they manifest and how they suffer.
We also have multiple studies on what we see as a negative correlation between the amount of mental disorders among people with or without a mental disorder; mental debilitation.
Some of the studies on this topic are very nice with multiple methods or ways to measure mental illness but there's a reason for this.
Most of these studies are using either interviews or a hospital sample as methods.
What makes them particularly informative but not yet conclusive is that each method has its own limitations.
People with or without mental disorders, people with major depression and mental illness are different in their response to treatment but still have similar rates of death.
A lot of the studies that have done better than no statistically significant at all studies look at death rates that have been corrected for people with mental diseases are very limited in nature.

Also, although there are some significant concerns about low csf, the vast majority of neuropsychological testing is conducted at two years of age.
You simply can't be sure if they will improve the condition before they are tested.

267,GPT-2 Summary,"Pregnancy-associated disease rates are higher; genetic predisposition towards it is linked.
Pregnancy-associated chronic disease burden in pregnant women is higher.
An association is established between prenatal exposure to alcohol and chronic liver disease.
The link between alcohol consumption and obesity and other types of metabolic illnesses.
Prenatal alcohol exposure also predicts persistent metabolic disorder and increased likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes, depression and cardiovascular disease.
Prenatal alcohol exposure raises the risk of developing diabetes mellitus in childhood and adulthood; however, the effects of prenatal drinking on risk of type 2 diabetes remain unknown.
Intratesticular Alcohol Exposure During Pregnancy and Adulthood (IEEPA) and Early Adulthood (EEEPA) is the most important population indicator that assesses exposure to prenatal alcohol.
It is the most important measure of prenatal exposure to alcohol because it requires measuring exposure to alcohol during normal development.
The IEEPA and EEEPA are two types of prospective cohort cohort studies of adults of reproductive age enrolled in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).
Intratesticular alcohol exposure during age 19 to 49 for both genders and racial/ethnic groups is associated with a higher risk of developing chronic liver disease (CVD) than other exposures studied in the population, including exposures from tobacco use or maternal smoking during pregnancy.
These results were corroborated by repeated case–control analyses, as well as data from several subsequent investigations.

268,GPT-2 Summary,"In summary, there exists ample research documenting the identification and characterization of various strains of yeast which causes various ailments, primarily candida haemulonii.
As previously noted, the advent of the field of molecular microbiology has brought along numerous advances in our understanding of yeast resistance, including the elucidation of the role of yeast in producing disease and providing a broad range of therapeutic approaches for these diseases.
However, the nature of resistant strains remain incompletely elucidated, largely owing to the lack of diagnostic tools and a lack of standardized methods to identify and characterize them.
A large, emerging field of microbial pathogenesis, based upon the premise of the role of microorganisms in disease, is the development of probiotics in the treatment of a wide range of conditions, as well as in the prevention of a variety of disease types due to microorganisms, including candida haemulonii, bacterial pathogens, alcohol abuse, obesity, obesity-related diseases, autoimmunity and numerous other disorders.
A good example of this research is the establishment of a specific strain of Candida albicans, which occurs in many individuals under conditions where food contact with any microorganisms can be a significant source of infection, including patients with candida haemulonii infections.
Candida albicans is a microbe of unknown origin which may possess several resistance alleles, all of which are highly specific for Candida haemulonii.
There are currently three established strains known to cause Candida haemulonii infections.

270,GPT-2 Summary,"I was just re-reading a review of medical literature this evening after studying it extensively online and coming to an understanding of your hypothesis.
After reading back through a number of related articles I was surprised that my original article hadn't been presented here so it is very important to make something of this discussion.
In short the literature suggests that men and women have different ways of evaluating lumbar pain and this is not a new finding!
Further, the literature suggests women may be more vulnerable to pain.
However, my original conclusion that men may be more sensitive to lumbar pain and women to cervical pain was wrong.
I apologize for any confusion.
So to sum it up let me begin with a general review of the literature available and the available literature.
I am not going to be too thorough in discussing each particular aspect of this topic as these are simply examples of a plethora of information available and I do not wish to burden anyone with too many specific details.
tl;dr: I believe female medics should not be assigned to specific pain relief positions.
I believe all medics should be given information on how to accurately assess and assess appropriate treatment options.
If a woman is experiencing neck pain (and no pain at all) and her practitioner is unable to provide pain relief options within the appropriate parameters that can actually be helpful to relieve her pain.
In terms of neck pain and spinal cords injury, this discussion should be directed to a doctor with experience treating neck injuries so this is all very well, as long as it is a medical necessity."

271,GPT-2 Summary,"Tissue engineering is an evolving field with a large amount of information and many questions.
The goal is to create a better clinical tool within the context of surgical procedures, improve accuracy, increase patient adherence to surgery, and improve outcomes due to improved patient adherence.
It has been difficult in some years to define the tools available, as many different components have been analyzed in different studies.
The results are now available and can be summarized by the following:
Mechanical and robotic tool construction technology for use in the study of complex and distal (longitudinal) tooth pathology have significantly improved in the last decade.
Surgical technique has advanced exponentially with an emphasis on improved quality of life rather than just a minimality of complications.
In recent decades, dentistry has evolved and patients are increasingly demanding solutions that can be used in the modern era.
While the tools for tissue engineering have advanced significantly with respect to complexity, the tools themselves continue to face challenges in terms of accuracy, ease of application, and efficacy.
It is important to remember that surgical procedures involving molar manipulation have been increasingly used.
It is important to consider the use of the technology to the patient as well as the device to guide its application when making the initial decision regarding how the wound is to be treated so that the operation can be completed as safely as possible.

It is important to avoid the term 'SCPS' when discussing cases of SCPD with others.
Individuals, families and individuals affected by SCPS may develop similar causes, such as a single genetic abnormality in the right hemisphere of the brain.
As an alternative term, 'cranial dystrophy' may be used.
In this clinical practice guide, we will use the term 'SCPS' for those individuals, families and patients who may have the following disorders:

SCPS.
This is the most common form of SCPD and approximately one in 50 individuals will manifest it.
It is a progressive, neurodegenerative and inflammatory disorder that affects motor skills, sensory, motor and speech abilities.
Approximately 1.6 million individuals worldwide have at least one SCPS diagnosis.
Scans of the brain are generally normal in most cases.
Sometimes, however, anomalies, especially when there are multiple sclerosis (MS) associated genetic abnormalities may be present.
Sudden onset SCPS is most often seen in young, healthy adult children under 20 years old.

274,GPT-2 Summary,"-Nuclea structure to explain the many differences between organisms based on their chromatin structure or functional parts.
There are numerous differences between species including dna, RNA structure and RNase II, protein structure and functional units that allow us to identify the fundamental basis of all species structure and function.
This is especially the case in humans.
It is even more important in animals.
The human body and brain is quite remarkable for how complex life forms have evolved.
In animals, however, as explained above, dna does not describe the common structure of the body but how complex living cells have evolved.
It just happens that different animal species have different structure types and therefore, different functions that are related to dva.
The fact that there are differences in all animals does not seem to cause them not to be functional.
However, we find that human organisms still maintain a common core of dna.
In all animal tissues there is likely to be another organ or tissue in between the dna and the dna based structure.
Some tissues can even be functional without being functional.
On a molecular level, dna is quite close to nuclei.
Therefore, the same principle applies to protein or nuclei, the difference is in the fact that this is in between the dna and the dna based structure.
If you think in your head of what is the actual cellular or DNA structure then most of it would be dna based, but there is much less to be concerned with with proteins, especially if not completely so.
A function of the protein depends on the protein type.
Some proteins rely on more complex proteins whereas other proteins only rely on the basic components in their protein.

276,GPT-2 Summary,"
In the study of patients with multifocal lumbar osteosarcoma (FMSOA) in the United States and Canada, total hip flexion and movement and hip extensor involvement were measured at age four years to assess their functional status.
There were 3 patients who had total hip flexion and 3 patients who had hip extensor involvement.
Femoral joint extension and hip extension were measured with a computed tomography (CT) at age 12 years.
Four days later, the remaining three had either total and hip extension or Femoral joint extension and femoral joint extension.
Of patients with total hip flexion and three patients who had hip extensor involvement, the hip flexion index was 0.8 and it was lower than that which equals 0.82.
In the remainder of this article, I will present in more detail why the findings presented suggest that hip flexion activation could play as a functional component or ""mechanical component"" of the disease and how this might be useful in the clinical and research understanding of ""flexor syndrome or associated muscle dysfunction.""

277,GPT-2 Summary,"It is common (10.8% of patients) that patients with combined immunodeficiency (19% of diagnosed patients) and/or immunoregulation-related blood disorder (20% of patients) may encounter resistance to targeted gene therapy (especially HIV).
It is important to recognize that although immune regulatory factors such as CRHs do not necessarily promote resistance there may still be latent resistance in patients who would benefit from the current gene therapy regimens if a treatment strategy (either CRH or immune-modulating agents such as HIV) are identified that improve viral genetic stability (more frequently with CRH alone).
A significant number of current clinical trials have targeted gene therapy in patients with combined immunodeficiency which can explain many negative responses with recombinant vectors (14,15), however for some patients in clinical trials, the clinical prognosis is poor (22).
This is due to the failure of the target gene therapy to improve viral genetic stability or prevent disease progression (17,35,43).
Many patients with combination immunodeficiency/AIDS find treatment difficult to achieve, especially during the early stages of immunologic recovery (38).
It is also important to remember that patients with both combined immunodeficiency and adeno-associated immunodeficiency (AAIA) have a decreased viral load due to HIV infection or to some other viral protein (43).
These patients may have compromised immune response during clinical intervention resulting in disease progression even when given an adeno-associated antibody (45) or CRH (48).

The ebola patient is a human with an inherited disorder in cytoplasm from the same mother who has not yet developed enough resistance to virus replication.
He's been suffering for several years from viral meningitis, followed by severe meningioma.
His medical team at ICU is extremely ill prepared in terms of their knowledge of ebola, and it takes time for a full diagnosis to be made.
Most of his family lives in the same community as the outbreak and there has not been any treatment or treatment associated with his illness yet.
Therefore, he was not allowed to fly into Boston today.
A medical response was expected during the past week to help with these urgent needs and so we have started communicating directly with him and sharing with him his medical history with both his mother and the health care teams handling the illness and the family's thoughts.
This effort has yielded significant results.
All these efforts may be successful in slowing down the EVD outbreak, if necessary.
Source: Ebola virus disease outbreak, November 2010

The Ebola outbreak, now called Ebola in the Occident (EBOV), is an extreme type of illness that spreads via close contact with an infected person and is primarily caused by a single strain of the virus that is highly lethal to health workers, particularly in highly exposed people.
It currently has no known cure or vaccine.
EBOV has killed over 1,000 people since the beginning of 2015, and continues to spread, so the potential for death and loss of livelihood is unprecedented for many people in the community.
More than three years after the virus was classified as a ""serious"" disease (though its global reach has yet to be fully appreciated), there are approximately 6,300 people in West Africa who have died of this disease.

281,GPT-2 Summary,"MS can be diagnosed when one of three distinct conditions that have been defined in one of six separate systems occur and at the same time they are interrelated, the three conditions are the neuropathological etiology and are: (i) autoimmune-type inversion; (ii) systemic-like or immunosuppressive inversion; (iii) immunosuppressive or antinuclear inversion; and (iv) autoimmune-type autoimmune-type central nervous system (see the Table for description of these three forms).
These three separate forms are: MS brain-injury, MS central nervous system injury, & peripheral neuro-inflammatory disease.
We will provide further details and explanations of multiple sclerosis etiology.
MS is not treatable unless the main event is caused by an autoimmune disease occurring in more than 6% of patients with MS. MS has been associated with other infectious and autoimmune diseases, including neuropathogenic viruses and toxins that we call cytomegalovirus.
An important contribution to current understanding of MS was made by Buss, Buss et al.
who observed that MS was associated with other infectious and autoimmune diseases (Buss, 1991; Buss et al., 1992).
In 1996, the first publication of the CTS:DMT (Cox et al., 2012) article was published.
It suggests that at least six autoimmune-type autoimmune-type inflammatory-type diseases have been associated with MS.
In 2011 Buss and colleagues had published a report in Tumor & Leukemia.
In this same report they described a neurogenic lesion that included inflammation, macrophage activation, and tissue death.
They also reported additional findings that MS has been diagnosed in patients without MS lesions, indicating that it is not a unique autoimmune disease.

283,GPT-2 Summary,"
To answer your first question:

Lippman's blood testing in the period of 1860 to 1907 (not included in the above) shows a median average HbA1c rate of 0.68%.
There are differences however not the least because of differing periods and types of blood tests and differing periods.
For example blood test rates have varied from 0.7% in France in the thirties to 0.25% in Israel in 1900 but the period where a HbA1c rate can be reliably used is from 1890 to 1939.
Since we cannot speak of different periods or ages, we can compare rates over time to see an increase with time.
However the rates do vary and so may not be directly similar, which would explain differences to a greater or lesser extent of varying conditions or age ranges of the different samples.
Here's a quick summary of the different ways blood collection has changed in various ways around us:

A.
From 1838 to 1850, a blood test is carried out during labour (called ""bariatric fever""), then when the women leave the hospital (sometimes even after delivering if they are healthy) blood tests are applied when the mother is discharged, usually around 20 weeks post delivery (this is not all that far) during this period of time.
A pregnant woman is normally able to give birth (as opposed to in the thirties and thirties when a blood test was usually only taken after birth) in some other time so this was an important tool for diagnosing post-partum bleeding.
In that time the HbA1C was 0.68% in Britain even though there were still strict laws against women from this time using contraceptives in Britain in addition to the existing regulations against bleeding during pregnancy.

Some people have heard of the effects of using thyroid trumpset with testosterone, specifically, trumpset with testosterone sulfate.

But the good news is that this isn't happening and it certainly isn't being produced.
You are safe because of the thyroid androgens.
But why would this matter, if you have the ""normal"" testosterone/steroid ratio, when you go without trumpset you have the elevated levels (I am not kidding, I think that about sums up the science).
What is the reason for this ""difference,"" and why does it matter?
Because you are getting the ""normal"" hormone for your body and as long as you do it regularly you will get the correct level of these hormones; it is important to remember that the body cannot function without the right level of the two hormones to help it function the right way.
The one advantage that this thyroid trumpset can give you in treating androgenetic alopecia is that you are getting the correct ratio of hormones to maintain body-weight with regard to the level of these hormones.
Since you don't need to worry about using the normal ratio, as long as you go with it regularly and it is used correctly it is not causing unnecessary weight gain or loss.

(2) TL is a well characterized component of the immune system and is extremely vulnerable to tumors.
3) T-tumors are difficult to find in humans as they are a poorly tolerated immune system of low immunogenicity.
4) TL is unique in the tumor community.
TL can be manipulated into immune suppressor agents, such as CXCR4 (human lytic virus CR), DSB2 (CD19+ cytotoxic protein) and LPC (Macrophage/Lymphocyte type clonal protein) or it can be manipulated into tumor-suppressor agent (Tumor suppressor, MST).
TL Activates Dendritic Cells and Monocytes, but Not Tumor Proliferation
TL inhibits monocyte proliferation.
In addition to being known for promoting immunocompetence to human T-cell lines and cancer, TL may additionally be critical for tumor growth.
This review will explain how TL may be important for proliferation and whether or not TL enhances and depletes monocyte proliferation.
TL promotes differentiation.
TL supports an accumulation of monocytes in the tumor environment and can increase differentiation.
TL inhibits cell differentiation, and inhibits tumor cell survival or function.
TL is essential for tumor growth and survival of tumor cells.
Many tumors produce soluble forms of tumor suppressor molecules that can inhibit TL or activate a T-cell signal.

One focuses on our research of dengue outbreaks: our ongoing effort to identify outbreaks with unique disease profiles.
Our team has worked on identifying new areas that pose a unique threat for human health within the area of transmission within the USA over the past several years.
This investigation has produced results as well as interesting new sources of information.
We identified two geographic regions within the American Southwest that have yet to be reported in the public sector, while at the same time, we've identified at least two new known endemic areas of dengue.
These new findings are part of a larger effort to characterize, as well as to collect, data related to new outbreaks occurring near the region of human exposure.
In developing this investigation, we used several of those sources when developing our reporting.
We've collected information on outbreaks from different reports including public reports, community reports, health surveillance data, school information, university information, media reports, case definition information, and more.
Over the past couple of years, and prior to publication of our articles, we have worked directly with two government agencies to develop methods for gathering and reporting this data.
We've identified four regions within this United States where dengue may be endemic to a few individuals in the area of study.
We continue to refine ways to identify, monitor, and prioritize areas of potential threat in our reporting, as well as new potential areas to investigate.
While we will continue working on this project, if we find that new areas of interest or areas that are significant based on prior studies we may expand the approach.
TL;DR - new dengue risk areas are identified from previous studies, and then identified through a comprehensive evaluation of existing outbreak data."

A case of a thirteen year old girl with two siblings was admitted to a local hospital on 12/14/17 suffering from generalized malnourishment.
The mother indicated that her young niece had one child which has been named ""Bunny"", although apparently it had no sibling.
The three first degree family had been married, she said; her husband was in a full nursing program, and the child was currently living at home.
The woman was able to provide a brief description of the child's face (no palm) and mannerisms, including the appearance of eyelids and nose.
She explained that his right hand exhibited very pronounced keratoconjunctival hypoplasia, but the other two fingers had normal diameter as well as thickness.
The examiner confirmed most of the clinical history: fever, fatigue, headache, dizziness, general distresses and vomiting, followed by diarrhea and weight loss.
She also noted that the child had a large number of fissure and ulcer scars on the right foot.
Her first question to the child: Did you do anything by chewing something?
The child replied that he did not eat a whole lot, only vegetables, beans, milk and fruit, but he could not get any of these things for long.
A nurse and other physicians who treated the child were able to clarify that no one had been drinking at the house where the child was currently"

292,GPT-2 Summary,"In this discussion we will look at how laser radiation can be applied directly to skeletal tissue to deliver high-energy ionizing radiation.
Also to further explore the application of laser radiation to the study of skeletal cancer, we must continue to look at other diseases which are associated with increased cellular damage.
The most comprehensive review of the research to date is in a new series of papers published in Radiation Toxicology and Health Effects, by Dr. David C. Zahn, MD, published by Columbia University Medical Center Press (Columbia University Press, 2009).
Since then numerous studies have been done to review the available literature on the effect of laser irradiation on osteoporosis including an investigation published in the New England Journal of Medicine in March 2007 titled ""The effect of high-energy laser laser radiation on osteoporosis in human models: a prospective study"".
Unfortunately, much of the recent scientific literature in that area has been severely challenged by several reviews published since by peer reviewers.
In addition to these critiques of review reports that do not follow the usual pattern of review, some critical comments have also been made here.
Although some of our current coverage falls into the type of ""rejecting the evidence"", we suggest that those who are critical should be more critical of current findings regarding the safety of laser irradiation and its application to osteoporosis.
Summary and Conclusion
Recent analyses by scientists with the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) indicate that the amount of radiation directed on bones by commercial lasers has become as ""effective"" as direct irradiation of cancer cells to produce the same results.
The NIH has confirmed that lasers can effectively irradiate bone bone and soft tissue without causing bone to degenerate"

An early stage trial also found no statistically significant difference in the average daily dose of mono (p=0.4) in the dose groups.
A meta-analysis found no significant difference observed when comparing monoclonal vs. lysergamides in the primary efficacy endpoint (dysfunction, aplastic anemia and lymphadenopathy).
After a third dose in combination with repertank inhibitors, no efficacy difference was found.
Both repertargin inhibitors (p-alanylcysteine and 2-mercaptopuricine) and 5-fluorouracil showed no significant adverse effects or serious toxic events in patients receiving oral doses of either monoclonal or lysergamides.
The study's authors speculated that the reason for the lack of efficacy observed with monoclonal is due not to the active antistagminoid activity, which likely had been absent in the primary trial.

Many years ago, a team of US researchers concluded that monoclonal antibody is safe and effective for the treatment of follicular"

What does it mean?
How much of the genome will be involved in determining fitness?
How do we test if you have two loci having similar fitness for the same function?

You're welcome.
I'd appreciate it if you read the first two paragraphs if you haven't already.
Interbreeding means you mix up your sex chromosomes and your father's genes.
Theoretically, you're mixing up the genes of each of your two parents.
These genes have to come from, in each case, their fathers, and from the same gene, that they share with themselves, so they're sort of a mixture of the genetic contribution of your father and their own genes.
In order to get enough of each gene at each place in the genome to contribute to each child, you're going to have to mix them all together.
Why must you do this?
Obviously, they're in competition.

It is not clear whether this is a pandemic, and there are some major issues with the data and its significance to this discussion.
2.
This is one of the biggest outbreaks ever seen, with almost two thousand cases reported.
It occurred on the island of Madagasc, on the mainland, and seems to have had a significant impact on people living in the region.
This outbreak appears to have been transmitted from one person to several thousand people without being isolated or contained in the world.
In fact, the information from medical research organizations is that there may have been as many as 1000 cases of chikungunya on the island of Guadeloupe on that day.
The same research found only two deaths.
Given that the data is very poor, the impact will likely be minimal from this outbreak.
There is no current confirmation of this outbreak occurring at any of the affected locations or the specific date or year of its occurrence.
As a result the effects seen are not clear-cut as to whether they are caused by the ""first world problem"" or whether they are due to the ""third world"" problem.
Additionally a very high percentage of affected areas lack water, food, electricity and other basic necessities.
In both cases the impact will not be seen until the situation is stabilized.
The potential impact of this outbreak at this time is minimal with no direct deaths and perhaps few other serious effects.
This is especially interesting as we are seeing the effects of extreme poverty in India, but it is not clear whether it is this type of impact that is causing people to engage or react this way.

303,GPT-2 Summary,"There have been several studies that examined whether glucose-6-phosphate could influence glucose-6-phosphate binding activity.
In both the laboratory and an in vitro study, subjects with insulin resistance experienced greater lipoprotein cholesterol accumulation with subsequent elevated serum levels of lipid:HDL-cholesterol than did healthy subjects.
Lipoprotein cholesterol seems to be an ""essential cofactor"" in glucose-6-phosphate metabolism and as a result may contribute to insulin resistance.
Insulin has also been found to bind the glucuronide on glucose-6-phosphate molecules with such high specificity that several drugs (gluconeogenesis inhibitors) can improve the function of circulating glucose to suppress its gluconeogenic activity.
Thus, glucose-6-phosphate may be the missing link in insulin resistance but it has been associated with a higher risk for developing diabetes mellitus.
TL;DR: A lack of insulin sensitivity could lead to the development of elevated blood levels of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol.
Excess free fatty acids in the liver are an essential cofactor for glucose-6-phosphate metabolism and glucose:HOMOLIN may be responsible.
TL;DR: 
Gluconeogenesis inhibitors can help with the development of insulin resistance as described above and thus may improve hepatic insulin sensitivity in patients with insulin resistance.
There has also been a relationship between increased total cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol that appears to correlate with insulin resistance.
These studies show a correlation between LDL-cholesterol and overall insulin resistance.
TL;DR: Insulin resistance is associated with insulin resistance and has been linked to type 2 diabetes and obesity.

304,GPT-2 Summary,"Encephalopathy involving an elevated serum protein (mMIP-1) may represent a degenerative autosomal dominant disorder that is associated with an overgrowth of the pre-natal face.
Weaver syndrome may represent an association that is primarily due to the increase in pre-natal bone age.
A possible association between neurogenic disease and the development of sotos syndrome, a potentially overgrowth of the pre-natal face in postnatal growth and development of the face, is presented.
The most common form of neurologic disease affecting persons younger than 90 years old are osteoporosis, rickets, skeletal problems, and diabetes.
This is caused by malformation of the bones underlying the skeleton.
In contrast to this pathogenetic model, we may present the first animal genetic entity, non-malignant sotos syndrome, that is associated with a relatively normal skeletal growth pattern and appearance.
It can also be considered as a possible association with osteoporosis and rickets, as the two diseases might be of different causes.
Furthermore, based on a study of sotos syndrome patients in Japanese infants with autism, we describe the results of a genetic examination performed on eight of the ten patients who appeared to be normal in this regard.
The patients were taken individually to an inpatient clinic and the diagnosis was confirmed.
The syndrome was also confirmed before or during the diagnosis in a majority of the patients.
These observations suggest that if the association of an altered skeleton of development has been noticed in such populations as Japanese infants we might be able to provide appropriate diagnostic tools.
In addition, if we consider the cases with normal skeletal growth pattern, we might be able to find out about the genetic origin of"

Read more about rhodophorans from our page on our official site :   rhizomycetidus 
The genus Rhizomycetidae is a large group of fungi found worldwide including Europe and South America.
The range in most parts of the world includes Africa, South America, Central America, Asia Minor and the Middle East and North Africa.
The fungus genus Rhizomycetidus was originally described by Strathdee and Bessant in 1902.
Habitat and ecology
There are diverse communities of rhodophorans in a wide range of habitats.
In the tropics and subtropics, they are mainly found in grasslands with high levels of shade, and in the drier, subtropical forests.
The genus has been named to distinguish them from another genus, Rhizomycopsis in order to preserve their similarity with the latter.
Rhodophoruinae have been reported to be involved in the propagation of many pathogens in many biotope environments including forest, grasslands, and shrubland.
In contrast, other forms of rhodophoroines, such as Rhizomycocycids, Rhodophorus and Rhodophorus trichosporosus are not capable of propagating a wide host range.
In the wet tropics, the rhodophoroinae of Rhodophorus form a closed-loop system, where a single species is always found in relation to multiple species that"

308,GPT-2 Summary,"One would imagine that this would be a discussion where people would be willing to argue this point at length, with many of the major points being made: On the surface it may appear that it makes much more sense to accept the deceased's transplantation as the same type of tissue as the donor body, as more research will likely be done in this area in the future to verify these results.
However, when you consider the various types of tissue donated, there are often many different tissues in each case - and when there is a shortage of tissue due to trauma it can be very difficult to determine the type of tissue being donated.
In order to ensure a high level of integrity and safety, a great deal of research is done on transplantation procedures outside renal transplantation.
In fact, many research institutions around the world continue to collaborate in this area to enhance the safety of kidney-dying patients.
For example, the transplantation of liver tissue has been conducted on some transplant recipients.
While the researchers and scientists are currently doing research in this area, they have not yet been able to perform a blood-based analysis of donor body fluids, which would determine the type of tissue of donor.
Additionally, the number of donors that are donors of donated organs is limited: less than 20% that are blood group recipients.
With a larger number of donors, there is more potential for abuse, resulting in more death certificates issued.
The most current study that is published on these issues concerns blood transplantation - though studies of blood donation in general are only limited.
At the same time, kidney transplantation is currently regulated and regulated under the guidelines of The World Health Organization (WHO).

309,GPT-2 Summary,"What if we were able to use a neural network to learn by comparing the number of times neural activity corresponds to the number of words in a text?
This is similar to the famous example of the brain's neural encoding of images from one to many, but there are also many other methods in mind that can be useful in learning.
This network will be used in studying learning on a large dataset.
I have posted a preprocessed example of the neural network.
If you use an ordinary text with a few words, but an image with several elements that is being trained, let's take a look at what happens when a random combination of the words and images is tested: There's one good reason why words start in the middle of a string; if some words have fewer elements that have more elements, the network is less likely to be able to follow the sequence of words and images it already knows in such a way that it can learn that the word starts at the beginning of the string.
In case we use the model from neural decoding of images to create real data, we will have to look at the difference between the two ways of learning which will probably be very important to understand what is expected of an effective learning method, and how we can achieve the best of each.
However, for now keep in mind the point I'm trying to emphasize: that no matter how powerful a neural network is, its main advantage lies in combining elements and creating new elements through the network.
You will, however, need to be able to manipulate the overall picture to create the result you desire.

311,GPT-2 Summary,"When a human embryo is transferred from mother to father via the spermatozoon a number of events occur simultaneously.
These events are the beginnings of the embryo's normal development.
This short series of events is the process by which the embryo produces an organism and therefore has the fundamental functions that any organism needs such as reproduction, learning and immune system activation.
In short when these events occur the embryo's genetic material has a potential to live far in the future.
So any individual with the potential for genetic preservation after this specific transfer is also protected by a gene that will not turn into an undesirable one.
For more information about the transfer see here.

314,GPT-2 Summary,"In my medical practice, every year a doctor's annual report contains data on the number of procedures performed per cent of patients visiting.
Each year, a physician's office is required to report the number of cases referred to them for laparoscopic surgery (a ""procedure"") under which no treatment is considered.
Unfortunately, every other year it is found that a significant number of these patients have been treated with less than minimal care.
This is because they had not received a proper consultation prior to the procedure and had no previous complaint of pulmonary complications in addition to having no chest radiography.
The problem with laparoscopic surgery for these patients is not their lack of complaint, but that they are uncooperative, and the majority still find a laparoscopic procedure to be unnecessary.
The Problem
Treatment for this complication is usually the same as that for other chest problems: the doctor has to treat the obstruction in the affected area.
This is known as a post-operative bypass, and is often done with chest compression or defibrillation (a technique that stops or restores heart rate immediately).
I don't know of a professional who has a solution for laparoscopic thoracoscopy by itself.

Therefore, to provide healthy body, radiation dose should not exceed a 1% maximum dose by healthy person for normal conditions.
-This radiation dose cannot be taken to exceed a maximum of one percent for radiation that is harmless to healthy body so no limit is allowed on actual dose as human body needs radiation to survive.
– Radiation dose, is equal to (energy loss per unit temperature difference) divided by (energy gained per unit temperature difference) divided by (energy consumed per unit temperature difference) divided by (energy absorbed per unit temperature difference)
-Radiation level depends on temperature difference which is approximately (body temperature)/(1.01×energy loss per units temperature difference) = 5 millirem (MIR) at 40 K and 10 MIR at 200 K
-1 millirem is equal to 910 K
-1 millirem is equal to 1,000,000,000,000 photons a second.
-One KMIR (1,000,000,000,000 photon/second ) is equal to 1000 microseconds
– There is a 1 to 50% health increase from radiation that is harmful to human body when average daily radiation dose is 1 KMIR.
– Most human body are not affected by this energy loss causing a normal functioning body.
– The radiation dose causes a loss of cellular energy to body due both physical stress and physiological processes.
-Coral and other coral species show a clear difference, they become less sensitive to radiation energy loss causes by radiation exposure.
Radiation can be used to grow natural coral ecosystem but radiation cannot be used as food source for coral as coral will produce radiation by destroying their tissues.
Therefore there is no way to produce"

317,GPT-2 Summary,"Sarcoscytosis (SSC) affects the metabolism of ATP at the rate of 0.4M ATP ATP is converted through a series of chemical processes causing protein breakdown and destruction.
Cells are able to keep up with the increased ATP and the resulting mitochondrial dysfunction does not take effect until about 10 minutes after SSC has occurred.
The cellular damage is mainly due to mitochondrial dysfunction in several cellular locations.
The mitochondrial membrane is most severely affected in the central nervous system, where an abnormal accumulation of ROS causes a breakdown of the mitochondrial membranes as evidenced by ROS production and mitochondrial hypoxia.
While this depletion causes membrane atrophy, the cell can maintain its function by releasing proteins that have different chemical structures.
This is how the cellular machinery is able to function.
In this case, the membrane is the organelle that generates ATP and the membranes function as the transport system to store ATP."

319,GPT-2 Summary,"Medical devices are often used to create a new body.
The body can be damaged by a single accident or a complicated disease, even by mere injuries.
Since surgery does not cause complete tissue destruction and is often relatively painless, it is ideal for some patients.
The material can also be difficult to repair.
Most bioplastic techniques have the potential to promote the new tissue growth during the reconstructive process and reduce unwanted tissue damage during repair.
For this reason, the amount of material made available by those methods is typically small in comparison to the cost to surgeons.
With the growing population of chronic pain patients in developing countries, a trend of increasing demand for high quality cosmetic implants for people with chronic pain, is making these materials even more widely used.
But there are significant pitfalls which lead to potential harm to the patient, especially due to the lack of appropriate care and supervision of the patient in care.
Patients should know what their health conditions are before they consult an expert or even try a new procedure.
This article provides a brief overview of various factors involved in the care of patients needing functional medical devices, including the possibility of health problems caused by the materials under consideration.
In addition to the main body of this article, I have also provided summaries of other articles in the same issue, most of which are available in the full text.
There are a number of materials and procedures that need to be considered when the prosthetic and any other type of materials are available to support the person.

321,GPT-2 Summary,"Iodine plays an important role in regulating the body's ability to respond to and adapt to iodine deficiency.
The mechanism underlying thyroid hormone function appears to be related to iodine's role in signaling iodine levels to the brain and, thus, to regulate iodine uptake.
It is estimated that 40 of the 200-400 thyroid hormone receptors that act in the central nervous system have been recently characterized.
The molecular basis for this molecular control of thyroid hormone receptors and for their regulation of thyroid hormone secretion is largely unknown.
The mechanism for iodothyronine's regulation of the circulating human thyroid hormone is unclear, but recent advances in the understanding of iodine metabolism and transport suggest possible mechanisms for regulating human thyroid hormone levels.
How It Works: As iodide iodide reacts with iodine to form iodine iodide, a ring of iodine molecules that contain a low level of iodine, and a super iodide that results from the combined reaction, ionize (OH).
After ionization, electrons are driven by the proton gradient and a single iodide molecule is formed.
The amount of proton is the amount of electrons (electrons/ion), and the amount of electrons generated depends on the amount of iodide.
As the proton gradient decreases the amount of time that iodine is added and oxidized, the amount of proton is smaller and the energy of the proton decrease in relation to hydrogen atom (OH).
Thus, the amounts of iodine are reduced until a small amount of iodine is required to create enough additional iodine to compensate the proton gradient and keep the level of iodine up to maintain its concentration within.
The iodide ring is the membrane, the iodide molecule is the ion, and hydrogen ion is the nuclei.
In this fashion the iodide iodide is either converted or converted to the pro"

How is this supposed to help?

TL;DR:
""The term fetal heart rate pattern (TFRP) is used to describe most common fetal heart rate patterns that have been identified by obstetric care providers in patients with spontaneous labor and delivery to the gestational age.
This article describes the use of fetal heart rate patterns to assist clinicians in designing appropriate management of induced labor.""

Acute Insulinism
Acute Insulinism
1) Acute Insulinism is a common condition with which most individuals deal.
It is characterized by hyperglycemia, impaired urination (the inability to obtain or make required fluids), and elevated serum glucose levels.
It is a rare disorder, with the frequency of diagnosis and reporting likely to increase as insulin treatments become more widely available.
The majority of hyperglycemia in the United States is due to the use and misuse of insulin (Hinshaw, 1981), but many cases may also result from inappropriate administration of insulin (Wiepert et al., 2002).
Many physicians have attempted to address the issue of acute insulinism through a variety of approaches, including the use of insulin injections or by prescribing insulin, but many of these are unsuccessful.
It now appears that some patients can use insulin medications without a hypoglycemic episode.
Hypoglycemic episodes are associated with a greater risk for developing severe clinical complications, such as coronary artery bypass graft or vascular occlusion.
These events can result from hypokalemia and secondary hypoglycemia and are often preceded by"

328,GPT-2 Summary,"Optical fusion and imaging of cell proliferation are both very important diagnostic methods and treatment guidelines, while a few examples are present here highlighting their potential and current limitations as human imaging techniques compared to animal models.
In this summary, my goal is to provide a detailed discussion of the state of medical imaging in our modern society and to illustrate the limitations of comparing human vs animal imaging.
Neural Imaging
Before moving on to my main topic, the first reason I think a major advantage of human imaging over animal imaging is animal brain studies.
From a non-medical perspective, our brains are incredibly complex, and we have no real analogue of what they are like or what's happening there.
Brain scans are the gold standard for assessing the integrity of a person's body, and they are the key tool to get to the bottom of a case of dementia with brain damage, for example.
So it can be difficult to understand the subtle differences between an MRI image and brain imaging done by a neuroscientist, and some studies are limited to clinical settings.
What we have with the advent of these animal models (  and the many more possible future human studies as well), there are no restrictions on comparing these brain images and MRI studies to one another.
One major advantage neuroscientists have over animal neurobiologists is that the animals are used to performing MRI experiments.
And since they are using the animals as their guinea pigs, they don't have the risk of injury to their brains, or even be sick (but they do need to be kept from eating or breathing).
This enables them to give clinical estimates of the risk when performing imaging in animals rather than rely on clinical observations alone"

329,GPT-2 Summary,"If you are willing to spend the extra money for TKA treatment then consider TKA treatment as a viable modality.
I will explain my thoughts on TKA, and how far I believe it is from being a legitimate treatment choice and will be able to give a thorough review of TKA to our readers.
In my opinion TKA treatment is worth consideration as a valid modality, however I recognize it will be difficult to achieve optimal results from TKA treatments of all types, and may have short- and long-term health consequences.
This post is intended as a more in depth review of TKA treatment modalities as compared to a more general review of conventional procedures in patients with hip or knee disease.
Read on for my thoughts and some recommendations.
In this post I will share how I would think TKA is designed to accomplish the following goals: - Improve mobility and function.
This is my opinion, as my own experience has taught me that poor flexibility and impaired mobility (especially knee dysplasia) is the most commonly perceived symptom in patients with hip and knee disease.
I will outline my reasoning here, and point out that TKA (in different forms) appears to work in this respect.
- Reduce the risk of long term complications such as osteochondral fractures, knee cartilage damage and fractures caused by degenerated bone marrow.
These outcomes are often associated with increased complications with conventional procedures.
These outcomes will usually be more of a problem with TKA or conventional procedures since there are no additional risks associated with TKA.
These benefits are largely because there is no longer the need for ongoing operations and there exists a very minimal risk of hip or knee fracture.
TKA seems to also allow the use of non"

330,GPT-2 Summary,"Elderly individuals frequently experiencing multimorbidity may need to be provided with holistic health care, it is not just for those with higher risk risk of complications, it can also provide a chance for younger participants, often younger than those living longer with multimorbidity, to receive care they will appreciate and who will seek help and are more likely to report better quality of life.
Elderly individuals are generally less prone than younger adults to receiving the care recommended and often will not be included in patient records that will record higher risks.
For patients of elderly patients elderly individuals need to be made into healthcare providers, especially in their own age group; they need care to understand what is being offered to them with care to provide accurate care to help them see that being older will not harm them and will bring better living.
This can be done largely by providing a greater focus on elder care for aging persons, and the elderly are often the most vulnerable individuals to this.
In the USA it is estimated that there are approximately 7.6 million individuals over 50 where current care and support programs for the elderly are inadequate, over one half of them are not covered by any insurance program.
The lack of any healthcare resources for elderly individuals has had to do with the fact that many of the programs of health care and services available to older people generally do not reach seniors, at much lower cost than their younger counterparts and also do not reflect their age.
The lack of resources that seniors need is largely the result of the fact that there have been no investments made into the elderly in decades.
This lack of funding has not only left fewer people with the ability to access care, it has also kept many elderly with chronic conditions under-insured, not covered by their own insurance while others pay for the services of a healthcare professional and"

Academic Journals - a significant percentage of journals published in any major discipline are published in a large subset of publications found as peer reviews, reviews and opinion polls for academic work.
While these methods of peer review are useful for identifying a variety of publications that are not published in the same field as the published work their usefulness does not extend to identifying scholarly objects by citation when published elsewhere.
It will be useful to compare the quality of scholarly review and scholarly publication methods that are provided by independent academic journals for different domains of quality according to the degree of publication, such as:
a.
In the non-professional industry journals.
b. in the professional, specialized professional academic journal (eg.
journals of professional management - the journal where the published work is offered as individual peer reviewed papers ).
Both types of reviews and citations of a work are used by scholarly publishers that are based on peer reviewing methods that are independent of the scientific quality of the content of the articles.
2.
In the professional journals, the standard review procedure uses a consensus procedure.
The standards of the scientific body are defined by editors for reviews and the peer reviewers in a scientific journal are based on the standards provided by the scientific body and are independent of the scientific quality of the peer review published in the journal.
There is a significant difference in the quality of review and publication of publications based on accepted standards of review that are established by the journal published.
3.
In the traditional journal system, authors (unpublished manuscript holders) use different peer review processes to obtain peer review approval of their work and authors review publication before publication.
The quality of publication varies based on if the peer review is done in peer reviewed journal or if it is done in general review method.

332,GPT-2 Summary,"Treated with systemic insulin treatment increased blood pressure as a side effect of insulin increased sympathetic tone but was not associated with more advanced atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.
The most likely causal link between TIR (sleep loss syndrome), OBS (osophobia) and sleep related disorders was suggested by the case series on SORDS published by the UK team in 2008.
The literature from the USA show more case studies of the occurrence of sleep related disorders in middle aged OAS, OBS and OSS patients with insomnia.
Most patients developed a mild, but significantly increased sympathetic tone during the night which may be a function of hypoxia or cardiac dysrhythmia; this effect of blood oxygen saturation may be less pronounced in older patients due to the increase in the rate of heart rate during the night.
OBS patients may have reduced central and peripheral function, possibly with impaired glucose tolerance or hyperglycemia.
For example, prolonged sleeping on a bed in the middle of a cold night may result in a decline in peripheral blood volume which may lead to diabetes mellitus.
(Liang et al., 2008).
Some data suggest that increased cerebral oxygen demand resulting in an increase in sympathetic tone may contribute directly to the decrease in central blood volume induced by SORDS.
TIR and OBS are associated with increased cardiac output in patients who suffer from sleep loss syndrome and may also result in decreased heart rate for at least 48 hours.
What causes sleep loss syndrome but not generalized OAS?
SORDS have been widely described as a progressive disorder with recurrent hypoxia of the brain, central hypoventilation and hypoactivity of the autonomic nervous system, resulting in chronic hypophagia.

TREATMENT AND DEPRESSION RATES AND CHILDHOOD DISORDERS
Erythyroidism is a genetic defect with an increased risk for mental retardation.
The prevalence of erythyroidism in North America is estimated to approximately 1%.
The prevalence of erythyroidism at childhood has been estimated to be between 75% and 100% in white and non-white children.
The rate of incidence in older children is 10-20% with some data of 25%.
It was hypothesized that erythyroidism occurs at any age up to age ten, and may be present in either the younger or the older children due to a decrease in serum or plasma levels of thyroid hormones.
While erythyroidism is associated with increased risk of both physical impairments and mental retardation it is not necessary for the early onset of the condition.
erythyroidism also may develop earlier and be more likely to develop, particularly in adolescents and young adults, than in older children.
Mixed with other thyroid related disorders including hypothyroidism patients suffer from emotional disorders such as irritability, depression, anxiety, social impulsivity"

335,GPT-2 Summary,"A new novel pain receptor, VGR, was discovered as a novel pain signal, probably in response to postsynaptic changes, may be crucial for analgesic function
I recently looked at the discovery of the VGR and how this new discovery is consistent with the current understanding of the role of peripheral afferent terminals in pain receptors.
VGR is found in sensory nerve endings of a group of nerve cells called neurones (see, e.g.,   www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/06/090611130129.htm ).
When the cell is released, the neuron releases a low voltage, the synaptic target for the VGR becomes functional (it triggers the release of the neurotransmitter glutamate but does not affect its excitability).
The VGR then releases a high voltage along with a signal indicating that the glutamate channel (in the neuronal cell) has been blocked (since glutamate plays a role in pain receptors).
Thus, in postsynaptic cells the voltage of a VGR is high, the VGR channel is blocked, the VGR pathway is blocked and the neuron stops receiving its excitatory neurotransmitter (serotonin or dopamine or something else) to its side.
A study of nerve cells using mouse models of disease showed that VGR channels are not only functional but they can even bind to drugs.
These neurons can provide a drug to the central nervous system (CNS).
(B) Glutamate agonist-induced calcium influx in brain.

CNS inhibition of VGR, by way of preventing NMDA receptor release and/or calcium influx, is likely at least partially responsible for the reduction of pain pain threshold and tolerance for pain perception in the treatment of chronic pain."

Post-operative evaluation using radiologically verified radiographs of both men.
The goal of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of a simple routine procedure for treating cancer by gynecologists in patients with rectal cancer.
Patients who have had rectal cancer are typically well treated with routine prostatectomy.
However, these patients often have limited access to radiology services provided by some gynecological clinics.
There is little data regarding the efficacy and safety of using simple laparoscopic prostatectomy for rectal cancer and the potential risks of subcutaneous fat biopsies that may be performed.
Our study was designed to investigate how commonly, and to the extent that rectal biopsies are performed, rectal biopsies can be used for prostatectomy in patients with rectal cancer.
The purpose was to determine the cost and benefit of rectal biopsies using a simple procedure that is not currently available to patients with rectal cancer.
Two prospective epidemiological studies found that rectal biopsies are highly efficacious and cost-effective in relieving symptoms associated with colon cancer despite an absence of a formal study population.5 The current design of this trial included both men and women and the cost was under $100 per operation.
There were seven gynecologists in our study who are knowledgeable on the treatment of patients with rectal cancer."

Odontogenic cysts are associated with decreased cognitive function, decreased functional mobility, osteomalacia, malignant growth, and neurodegeneration in a range of disease states.
A previous review of the literature revealed no apparent clinical applications of odontogenic cysts (see table below).
This new literature review includes all published reports of olfactory damage or alterations since 2009, when the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) reclassified odontogenic cysts as Endocrine Disruptors or Radicals according to the IARC definition.

339,GPT-2 Summary,"* In many cases, antibiotic resistance can be detected in the fetus through prenatal testing.
For example, one study found that if fetal samples were collected from patients of known high risk for infection, the number of antibiotic-resistant isolates was over 90%.
* This is the first study that reported an association with fetal infection based on prenatal testing.
Since the results are limited, it is not yet yet completely clear whether or not there is a relationship between maternal antibiotic exposure (exposure during pregnancy) and neonatal morbidity/infant mortality (see TL;DR for details.)
* The results of this study have implications for prenatal treatment of women with preeclampsia.
Previous studies have shown that increased exposure to beta hemolyses produced by high level beta hemolytic colonization of amniotic fluid could result in an under-researched and inappropriate fetal infection.
Additionally, some of the same studies suggested an association of increased maternal beta hemolysis with altered placental barrier function in pregnant women.
* In order to support the use of specific antimicrobials in the pregnancy, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends standardization of all pregnancy tests and guidelines for the care of pregnant patients, as well as the establishment of routine antimicrobial testing during pregnancy.
In order to better understand the association between maternal and fetal antibiotic-resistance, it is imperative to establish whether there is an overlap and a difference in antimicrobial susceptibility of patients and patients and their fetus.
* A second study conducted by a Danish team identified a significant amount of fetal isolates of Escherichia coli ( E. coli) and gram-negative bacteremia which correlated with early labor.

The following is a brief summary of known immunological pathways for prion diseases, as well as links to more detailed clinical information.
Prophylactic anti-Prion Therapy Immunodynamic therapy
Anti-Prion Therapy Immunology of prion diseases has been extensively investigated and published in most forms of medical literature.
This approach uses immunologically induced responses in healthy brain tissue.
The use of immunoreactivating cell and antigen presenting surface proteins has been utilized to induce anti-tumor immune responses.
For example, cell surface antigens are derived from specific cell types, such as cancer cells.
Tumors often possess a specific antigen that triggers cellular immune responses.
Cell surface antigens are generated and produced as the result of specific immune responses in abnormal brain tissue.
By targeting antibodies to specific cell types (tumor antigen and cell surface antigens) and by immunoadjuvant delivery of specific anti-tumor antibodies to specific cell types (such as cell surface antigens), anti-tumor immune therapies are applied to both the immune system and tumors.
This approach is termed ""antimicrobial therapy"".
Tumors are generally considered ""immune dependent systems"" and should therefore have their own ""specific IgG"" (in vitro)"

A look at the data
My research was designed to assess a recent high risk HIV-1 patient described in a major journal article entitled,  Infectious Disease  (2011).
What does this study show, in particular, with regards to this patient and an unknown amount of other HIV infected people?
First step for those seeking more clarity on this topic is this chart.
If you click on this one you will see some interesting results.
The first chart seems to indicate that almost seventy eight percent of people with hiv who are currently being cared for in a hospital have been treated for HIV when infected by some unknown third party.
So what?
Let's go back a little further.
The second chart is very similar as well but with information from the national health survey.
Again, it seems that we have an increase of nearly twenty one percent of people with hiv who were actually diagnosed with HIV but were treated for it.
I'm not going to give any more details but just point out that one can argue that the CDC might have done research on individuals with hiv who were treated for it without getting their HIV virus tested.
That is what I'm going to do.
I would like to thank Dr. Bruce Chassy for his research on this.

346,GPT-2 Summary,"
Electrons are excited by any electric signal emitted from a particle(s) of a magnetic field, which can provide a strong electromagnetic field.
When electrons move in magnetic fields they lose their properties of conductivity.
To counteract this loss, one electron must be charged up; as a result of excitation, charged particles are trapped within magnetic fields, the larger they become, the more charge they lose.
When these charged particles reach a boundary or quantum boundary, their magnetic fields cancel out and they move back to their original state or are absorbed into another plane of space or are absorbed into other particles like electrons

In fact, the electromagnetic field may be directly measured directly, and it will be shown exactly how electromagnetic force in a magnetic field plays a role in the magnetic field properties and properties as a function of energy flow in the magnetic field.
The above-mentioned article presents the first attempt to explain the phenomenon of electromagnetic fields as a new fundamental energy that plays a major role in the structure of electrical components.
It also shows that this phenomenon is not a property of any one physical field but will play a strong role in the structure of the electronic applications.
It has therefore demonstrated the energy of a specific electromagnetic field on a magnetic surface by exploiting the principle of interference by electromagnetic force in one magnetic field.
In the following discussion, it is shown that this effect is not present in the form of direct charge or charge on the surface or in the electric field, but is mediated by the interaction of magnetic fields and charged particles.
This results in the electromagnetic energy acting on the charged particles.
The electromagnetic field acts on charged particles to act on charged particles to act on the charged particles for the same reason: as electromagnetic force acts on the charged particles, this results in charge"

348,GPT-2 Summary,"1) There is a strong desire to access health care based on electronic health records for all but a few health needs.
This desire for care is being driven by a healthy consumer population where digital health technology can be applied to meet critical patient needs.
An existing electronic health record application is not enough at present due to not sufficiently motivated physicians to utilize or retain the data and to allow them to use it safely and appropriately.
Two companies are trying to change that as part of their digital medical records initiative - Health Management Associates and Aetna.
These products are developing additional applications for mobile devices and have developed mobile websites that allow for the usage of secure communication, data storage, and management methods with data sharing being considered in some areas as well as for public monitoring.
Aetna is in early initial stage development of an improved version of the Health Management Suite based on a Health Management App for mobile devices and is providing early opportunities for use of proprietary communications with Aetna's clients.
2) Aetna has partnered with U.S. based technology integrator, IKONO to implement a new provider oriented development strategy that includes access to their technology with an emphasis on early implementation of delivery systems that may include physician-led electronic health records in primary care settings.
One of the challenges for providers is implementing this new approach and developing a plan for implementation to allow for full coverage of this new tool.
Aetna's initial efforts will be focused on providing the current provider-led electronic health records solution, the IKONO Mobile app, that meets both the needs of providers and would make it possible for them to continue receiving their payments and will further develop new business models for their business.
3) Aetna's goal is to provide its patients with the information they need to be well connected with local health care providers and will introduce an enhanced version of the online health records application.

349,GPT-2 Summary,"R-V may improve prognosis in chronic lung disease (eosinus in this case) with associated pneumonia or bronchial pneumonia
How do we measure effectiveness as a treatment using a blinded RCT method?
When compared to conventional treatment, there is a higher risk of adverse events.
As such the outcome in the RCTs is usually a mild to less common than that of the non-therapeutic treatment.
The RCT method used in the case studies described below compares risk between R-V.
Thus R-V has been shown to reduce both mortality and morbidity in this group of the lung disease.
The rationale behind this is that R-V is more stable than conventional treatment such that it retains the pulmonary cells, which is required for the treatment to be effective and have an expected clinical outcome.
In addition this method was shown to give more reliable, accurate and comprehensive results thus demonstrating lower incidence of death associated with conventional treatment compared to R-V.
Treatment of lung cancer usually takes between 6-12 weeks of course depending upon whether an R-V treatment is required or not.
However, a brief evaluation of the R-V treatment for clinical reasons will ensure that the risk of death is considered to be less than that of normal lung disease.
R-V compared to other treatments for chronic lung disease 
The method used in the literature for assessing lung cancer in smokers was based on two factors: age group and duration of use of cigarette.

351,GPT-2 Summary,"The curcumin found in fish is a relatively new compound and therefore not well studied extensively in humans.
It appears to have potent antiinflammatory properties of its own.
It was proven to increase chemokine expression of a host of inflammatory cell lines that have been associated with diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.
The antiinflammatory properties of curcumin seem to be tied to the fact that it was successfully used to fight the inflammatory reaction induced by an experimental anti-inflammatory drug.
The drug developed by the pharmaceutical company was an anti-angioplasty drug, and the curcumin found in fish was the agent that was successfully tested and used to decrease that reaction.
This research is the first step in our understanding of the antiinflammatory properties of curcumin and how it may be used safely."

352,GPT-2 Summary,"I decided to go about research I want to follow traditional medicinal path because I like them.
One thing I need to keep in mind is that my understanding of traditional persian medicine is not at all in their favor.
I do not find it interesting and have many issues with their methods.
I think more research is needed though as it has important implications that I want some knowledge to bring to my study path.
The study should have 3 main points:
1.
The present study focus was the medical impact of the heat related deaths as reported by newspaper reports from various countries in 2010.
This survey was conducted by a global research collaboration known as the Performing Research Network Project.
We surveyed various populations around the world to see what kind of healthcare related deaths occurred during the summer.
The authors and the researchers are a group or organization that focuses on research on infectious diseases and aging associated with heat stress.
2.
We looked at how heat related death rates of all over world and countries varied.
We also looked at the results from other research groups focusing on similar topics such as heat exposure and mortality in general.
The key point to keep in mind is that this study used a variety of different reporting sources and methods so you are looking at a global database so you need to include sources as well as measurement methods.
This also made it important to provide additional data to support the information.
We had to find a way to create the data that was robust to heat and all that happens on site due to weather conditions.
With that said the results are a very interesting and exciting article to my point of view.
I have been reading traditional persian medicine for some time now and it has made some of my research progress but in an interesting way.

353,GPT-2 Summary,"-Phenotypic (sib synaptosomal complex I) activity with low interspecies transmission was demonstrated for macaque monkeys in their native forest where exposure was not unusual and where monkeys had been captive bred and used only for the experiment.
-It is not uncommon for disease transmission in the wild to occur from a captive bred animal.
This may mean that the transmission in wild monkeys is very uncommon and that other animal species are unlikely.
-The risk of having a disease like the ""pneumonic plague"" in wild populations may be greater.
We do not expect to see a global epidemic but rather the risk from domestic animals may be low.
Please note:
- This study was conducted in the same facility as that of the new studies discussed in this article.
The laboratory was used for the study by the same two labs that conducted the research on wild monkeys and they performed the studies.
- We cannot make any conclusions about transmission for other animals outside the tropics because of the small population structure of the original populations and the fact that they lived with other monkeys and had a short life span.
The original studies were conducted in other areas and did not test for the spread of disease between human populations, though the results were consistent across all these areas.
- This study was not designed to identify any specific animal populations more likely for wild monkey disease transmission than other.
We tried to avoid doing so by assuming that other animal species were more likely for wild monkey disease transmission than with their domesticated counterparts.
By excluding monkeys from the data used in these studies, we tried to make sure that if one were to find that the human population"

354,GPT-2 Summary,"Infected teeth have a low chance of developing cancer when oral hygiene and oral pathology and the treatment of these diseases need to take a front seat.
We know of no published reports of dental pain associated with dental decay, especially dental pain with tooth decay due to the difficulty for patients to achieve a full and efficient treatment and pain for children due to the difficulty to see and to avoid an oral wound when not properly cleaned.
Here we present two simple methods that enable treatment of dental decay in children for the treatment of dental abscesses, tooth discoloration, and mouth ulceration.
However, there are many other ways for dental treatment of decay in children.
SUMMARY:
These methods require only 2 hand equipment (one from each mouth).
Each surface requires only 2 materials to fill:
H2O2 solution
Lactose solution
Infects dental floor surface to prevent them from growing tooth pulp, removing decay and cleaning it out
Ensures the oral surface receives adequate amount of water, in other words prevents dental cavities from growing tooth pulp
Infects surface to reduce its surface area to prevent decay
As soon as these two surfaces are inserted in the mouth, they act as a sponge to provide moisture to the mouth and prevent tooth decay.
THE METHOD
The procedure is used to:
Fill the dentist's mouth with liquid to prevent mouth ulceration
Fill the upper portion of the tooth disc with liquid to prevent dentin from growing
Infect the tooth cavities, removing decay and cleaning them out
Remove dental decay and treat it as prescribed
The following materials work together in this method: -H2O2 solution -Lactose"

355,GPT-2 Summary,"This study shows a very strong association between the use of antiplatelet medications in post-surgical ICUs and progression to angioplasty and angioplasty progression to angioplasty is associated with greater use of thrombolytic antiplatelet medications.
The positive associations are seen at one thousand post-surgical ICUs in countries with high rates of angioplasty and post-surgical cardiac arrest.
Further validation of this approach will be needed but the evidence presented here suggests that, in general, a high use of thrombolytic antiplatelets before stroke is associated with better outcomes than low use.

356,GPT-2 Summary,"2 months postoperatively after successful surgical resection they are the subject to gastric bypass and bypass of endometriosis
TL;DR2.
The risk to life and limb in men with a diagnosis of endometriosis is asymptomatic and can be avoided with timely treatment of symptoms, the risk to life and limb can be reduced with early surgery and even partial removal.
What may not be obvious is that even though surgery is often the least costly option available in many cases, it requires immediate access to anesthesysts, incisions and/or percutaneous surgery to prevent complications postoperative.
One might also wonder if men with a diagnosis of endometriosis are treated in a different manner than men without.
The risk of mortality in endometriosis is high even without treatment and is far greater during surgery than non-endometriosis surgery.
Clinicians working in endometriosis care should note that although non-Endometriosis surgery, surgery is possible, it is highly risky.
This risk can be reduced by prompt access to anesthesysts and early access to laparoscopic procedures; in fact, if a patient has been advised of the potential to benefit surgically from non-Endometriosis surgery, they are much more likely to benefit postoperatively because surgical outcomes are usually more favourable with immediate access to surgery than they are the second time around.
I would recommend endometriosis surgery in a patient with a history of severe complications even if treatment has already been completed in other areas of their life."

357,GPT-2 Summary,"The following article will explain in detail how to diagnose and treat pleura fissures, which we have identified via our detailed histopathologic study of pleural fissures of humans.
The following image below should illustrate the distinction we can make in these cases based on facial morphology.
Each red domeshape is a cyst, the two smaller ones having two small squamous lesions on their sides while the larger two have two larger one-sided squamous lesions (yellowish dark lines) on their sides.
Notice that these plaques occur almost constantly on the affected face and are associated with the large size of the subcutaneous lesions.
Also remember that facial cysts are present in other tissue (cavities, blood vessels) which normally show less signs of disease.
This illustration shows a healthy male with a pleural fissure of unknown origin and an enlarged subcutaneous lesion.
(from the original poster via Wikimedia Commons)
This is an unusual case as the underlying plume is present right on the occipital face, the disease usually appearing right around one's eyes.
This is usually a consequence of a previous surgery performed for this malformation and, since no scarring has occurred on the external face, it is likely due to superficial injury to the face caused by this procedure.
Here's a picture of a sample of my fissures; note their color, structure and size in each image:

So far, studies have been performed.
The results may be positive, but is there a benefit in transplining stem cells to regenerate damaged blood vessels?
The study that is now completed reports that transplanted stem cells grew faster on the donor's blood vessels.
A more recent study (this one at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill performed using a more representative sample) did not appear to show significant benefit in patients treated with the stem cells.
I am unable to find research articles that have demonstrated a significant benefit in patients treated with stem cells.
Are stem cells more resistant to infection when combined with other donors?

363,GPT-2 Summary,"Internet Addiction (IA) is defined under current DSM-5 (5th ed) as an excessive use of the internet or similar devices
It presents itself in various forms, including problematic internet use, binge internet use, and hyperphagic internet use.
As a general matter, internet addiction is an Internet Use Disorder, often characterized by excessive internet use.
It may also be seen as a psychopathy, narcissistic, or borderline disorder.
This document is dedicated to understanding current studies and the use of internet as a mental disorder, which appears in DSM-5's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5).
Internet Addiction Research
Internet addiction research is a large research field, that uses the internet as a means for self-expression and exploration (Hicks 1988 ).
Research shows that Internet users may be prone to mood disturbances, anxiety, aggressiveness, and mood disorders.
It is not hard to see that Internet addiction affects both genders equally.
A large majority of researches focus on men, though women are more likely to suffer from internet addiction.
According to the United Nations, 2.8 million girls and 2.5 million boys between the ages of 13 and 18 are affected by Internet addiction.
These findings on female Internet users, indicate that they are more likely to struggle with internet addiction than men due to physical, emotional, or sexual abuse.
This, shows that their emotional and psychological distress may be related to the problem of Internet Addiction.
Another study shows that an increased rate of internet users is associated with hypersexual behavior, while internet addiction research also shows that it can also affect the male mind (Hicks 1988 ), as well as girls.
The most frequent problems in accessing social networks (social anxiety/panic attacks, internet addiction) are also found to be greater than they were last year (2014).
This is because many of the most severe Internet addicts"

364,GPT-2 Summary,"What is different with fear?
The two most important parts of the pain response are a general increase in pain sensitivity with associated an increase in a pain threshold to get pain to feel pain and an increased pain threshold to stop getting pain.
What is the difference between the pain thresholds and the pain thresholds versus pain thresholds?
The pain thresholds can only be measured to a certain point in the response and there is no point.
If you get a spike in your pain threshold then that means the pain threshold is gone, so not because of the pain threshold.
If you get a spike in the pain threshold and nothing else than the pain threshold then it just means that the pain thresholds are set up in pain sensitivity and they are not changed.
What did you think you were getting from ""Fear triggers a pain threshold jump? ""
I got what I always wanted:  an improved understanding of emotional pain, which I always got with fear.
No wonder so many people got sick after the first time they saw a screaming woman on the TV.
I don't even remember her name.
There is a pain threshold in the brain that seems to go up when you start thinking fear and people usually just react on that.
So what about all the others?
All the other types.
The pain threshold jumps up when you start wanting a pain and it increases with the level of the experience.
That is the case for fear if its really scary.
We all have a threshold that just increases by experience.
I got the same threshold when I saw the video where the woman comes out of the house naked so I was pretty used to seeing that.
What about ""Don't give a shit what they tell you"".
I just wanted to get this ""Don't give a shit what they tell you""."

366,GPT-2 Summary,"In the United States, we have more women in labor who die in childbirth than we did 40 years ago.
The United States birth rate is declining, and it makes more sense to expect some degree of harm from women having more babies or who are having more births in a given time period than to expect no harm from childbirths.
In my last blog I discussed the role of gestational age and other obstetric variables in pregnancy outcomes, but I hope this talk further highlights this finding.
The study included 839 births in five states.
Of these, 678 were women between 20 and 45 years old, and the others were women 45 and older.
For all women born between 1970 and 1994, 15% delivered within 7 weeks of pregnancy, and 6% delivered by the end of the day after the 29th week of gestation.
Compared with women under 30, women in their mid 25s and women aged 30 to 44 had a similar likelihood of delivering at least part of their labor.
The reason for the discrepancy is that, after accounting for confounding variables, including race, age, education, marital status, and poverty level, the relationship between early gestation, low birth weight, and high risk childbirth has remained.
Women who have delivered in the last 7, 12, and 14 weeks of the pregnancy, as well as those who delivered after giving birth to 2 or 1 infant were all at higher risk.
There appear to be three main reasons for this.
The most obvious cause appears to be the fact that pregnancy complications are more common for women who delivered earlier than men.
The study authors speculate that having more babies increases the likelihood that a woman will develop pregnancy complications.
Some of this may be explained by women having more children later in their lives, while others are probably a result of maternal weight loss in early pregnancy.

1.
Don't treat people.
Period.
That's why metastatic tissue growth is often referred to as 'cured' and is often a 'wisdom quote'.
You can certainly avoid it with surgery.
But you should understand there is likely to be more risk with any surgery.
2.
Treat for a life threatening disease.
To the individual it will feel like it's working for you, but for the community the risk is immense.
My heart goes out to those who will have to spend time on the waiting list this year waiting months or years for care.

To me, the most common question that comes up when reading about my clinical experience is one in many.
It's a question often asked of me.
""Well how long will it take to cure your tumor?""
and most often this is answered quickly, and it leaves me in no doubt the question can't be answered right now.
I've had numerous people, most of whom are my colleagues, say as much.
The answer is really not any better.
It would need weeks-to-years; or just days.
There are also the potential long term consequences.
Many tumors don't go away.
In fact, some of them recur.

This will help reduce the spread of new STDs, provide information for health care providers, and assist in identifying the most common STDs.
However, without additional public health resources we cannot effectively treat and/or prevent infections for an extended period of time.
We, at BlueMeal Therapy have spent years educating individuals around the world about STDs and prevention and how the world's most populous country is working on it.
Today (2015), we are launching this initiative with the aim to reduce the exposure and spread of STDs, increase the numbers of people tested, and educate the public about the disease.
What we are trying to do with this project
1) To help people learn about STDs, so they can be educated better or prevented from getting infected
2) To learn more about STDs or the most common ones.
The purpose of this project is to use this information and to develop a clinical trial using BMS to teach both health care providers and members of the public how to identify and contact someone who may be experiencing one or more STDs.
An example of patient education can be seen HERE The study is targeting individuals with HIV testing levels as low as <5% (the low end of the range that is considered safe) over time, a subset of the population.
What will happen in this study is that individuals will use BMS to ask someone to check the status of themselves and their partner and/or to test other persons (and therefore have a greater chance of a positive test result), but to only allow this test when the person is on treatment, even for non-sterile conditions that can result in sterility.

371,GPT-2 Summary,"(1) Immunoglobulin E anti-TNF antibody test is superior to antibody based anti-TNF tests by using the current clinical standards.
(2) No data demonstrate a relationship between the prevalence of autoimmunity and age.
(3) Serum TNF levels are higher at an age greater than 80 years in persons aged >55 years with a high prevalence (60%) in children <12 years of age with significant age related differences between groups.
(4) The ability to detect a significant autoimmune response correlates with improved survival in patients with autoimmunity.
If this is the case, any benefit in the patient-care environment may be less than expected, because greater awareness and less frequent need for surgery would lead to reduced patient services.
To discuss what might be expected and what evidence remains unimpressed, and whether there are future studies aimed at improving the identification of autoimmunity in age-related disease, it is necessary to examine the diagnostic criteria and testing for the diagnosis.
The clinical significance of immune markers can be evaluated following an independent approach to the question of age-associated autoimmunity.
We therefore discuss why the autoimmunity diagnostic criteria may not be sufficiently precise for the definition of autoimmunity, and whether there are additional criteria to be applied to examine autoimmunity.

Stat 1 is an actinlike protein protein of proteinase activity which has a large area with a higher degree of specificity and affinity for the kinase substrate than is protein-coupled proteins like the non-proteinase kinase or the phospholipid.
Stat 2 and 3 are ligand receptor protein that are primarily required for the phospholipid-dependent phospholipase cascade.
Stat 4 is a complex of the 2 protein phosphatase-taktik pathway complex with Stat 5 as its subtype 1 and 3 as subtype 2.
When Stat 3 is inactivated by a kinase inhibitor like riluzole with the Stat 3 protein, then Stat 1 is destroyed leaving Stat 2 and 3, which are phosphorylated, unaffected.
Stat activation by a kinase inhibitor like lixocumab with Stat 1 and 3 phosphorylation is the preferred method of stat generation for Stat 3 when stat 3 phosphorylated Stat 1 or 3 is not phosphorylated through an actin/myosin kinase activation.
Stat 1 has also been used to determine the target of Stat 3, which can be determined by identifying the phosphorylation of the associated Stat3 by the chemosensor.

374,GPT-2 Summary,"Loss of digestive enzyme function and/ or sensitivity to gluten is the leading cause of inflammatory bowel diseases.
Some individuals present with diarrhea for the first time; however, celiac disease prevalence has jumped dramatically since the 1990s.
Research indicates the gluten-related inflammatory bowel diseases may increase risk for other specific autoimmune diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, osteomalacia, and autoimmune thyroiditis, though more research needs to be done to determine what exact contribution other inflammatory bowel diseases and/ or diseases may be responsible.
The gluten sensitivity and autoimmunity disorders appear as distinct medical syndromes and often cause significant impairment of the immune system.
TL;DR.
Although gluten protein in childhood has always been associated with intestinal symptoms and/ or celiac disease there is a substantial body of evidence ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3036789@. )
linking childhood exposure to gluten to an increased risk of these specific inflammatory bowel diseases and non-lophotropic autoimmune diseases.

Several specific autoimmune syndromes and disorders involve non-functional gut immune cells and inflammation, and their association with celiac disease is consistent with a connection between gluten use in childhood and increased risk for multiple autoimmune diseases, all of which are now recognized.
All these specific autoimmune and/ or autoimmune thyroid disorders may be associated with the associated inflammatory bowel pathology.
TL;DR.
This is a short and to the point post.
It is based off of two very recent articles which I encourage you to read, which I believe have been significant in their discussion of wheat sensitivity and autoimmunity disorders and their potential role as trigger conditions for intestinal symptoms.

376,GPT-2 Summary,"The study had a number of flaws, many were explained but even with all the flaws described the study is valuable in illustrating the need for evidence based approach in child custody and visitation practices, such as age based analysis and individual needs assessment.
A quick overview
The study has flaws that may not be immediately apparent.
To begin the study, one researcher could not agree on the names of the study participants.
That is a problem when investigating research designs like this, but it can get worse when authors are not aware of these issues before conducting the research.
Most of the flaws are in the raw data presented, such as the nature of measurement of age of the individuals, or the types of studies used.
This does not make the study useless, but it does reduce the rigor of any validity analysis.
The author chose to focus on one area that might be considered the most important finding from this paper is that children are not in a better position than adults to develop emotional support systems.
This finding is important because we are all involved by relationships in our children's life (parents, parents, siblings).
In order for emotional support to build, there needs to be positive external influence for the child to reach for it through positive feelings, behavior, or other mechanisms to initiate positive responses such as positive reinforcement where the child wants that behavior but not the actual physical behavior such as hitting or slapping.
In addition, children often find it very difficult to provide for their own needs and safety needs because they lack the resources to engage with caregivers and develop the support mechanisms of self-compassion and empathy.
The authors of the study were unaware that they were not able to use age based analyses where they were able to provide evidence that children are not in a better position to engage in positive outcomes.
The author could not provide evidence supporting or debunking the claim that, after a period of"

377,GPT-2 Summary,"Meningitis is a chronic disease affecting almost 30,000 Canadians.
Most cases are among women aged 20-50 years.
This number is expected to rise soon.
There is less education about Meningitis than many realize.
In Canada, there are two major lines of inquiry about this disease:
Pneumonitis.
Most people are never aware of what they are putting themselves at risk for.
Most people do, however, know that there are diseases associated with Meningitis such as Chlamydia and Haemophilus influenzae type b bacteria.
One in three women is sexually exposed to these microbes.
So it is important to identify if you are concerned; for it does not occur for very long and can have very bad outcomes.
Most people are unaware of their risk to themselves due to the lack of appropriate health information about this disease.
If you have been diagnosed with Meningitis there is an opportunity to seek a specialist's attention for assessment and possibly treatment.
Osteopathic.
There is an established relationship between the use of certain types of osteoporosis and other ailments such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
A review article on osteoporosis and Meningitis reviewed the available information on the subject to give further clarity concerning the risk factors for these maladies.
Osteopathic osteoporosis in this province is a highly complex topic that has been in the public spotlight since 1997 (and again since 2010).
For the time being though, all who suffer from this disease have no right to assume that their treatment, medical, mental health, or life span are secure."

The nucleus accumbens (NAc) regulates perceptual perception.
The thalamus is involved in communication between different cortical regions across the face, including the frontal face area, and with perception of visual stimuli.
The thalamus also influences visuomotor and motor coordination.
Finally, the NAc is implicated in the regulation of emotion, both in healthy individuals and in Alzheimer's disease.

Brain structure, structures and function.
Anterior-posterior asymmetry across cortex
There are 23 anatomic regions in the brain that are homologically interpenetrated by the nucleus accumbens, the thalamus, and other nuclei.
Here is a list of their positions on a human face:
Bilateral symmetry: NAc anterior to posterior: parietal lobes occipital pole: temporal pole: bilateral frontosmopular nucleus: left amygdala: anterior thalamus: prefrontal cortex:
The NAc and the mesolimbic system, which is also related to learning, communication and memory, are not interpenetrated at any of these locations.
This diagram illustrates the relative positions of these nuclei in the nucleus accumbens, the ventral tegmental area, and the amygdala, which are all in relation to each other.
This diagram, known as the bilateral symmetry diagram, shows the differences between the contours drawn in Figure 1.

These ten million new cases of TB are due to new, less effective drug use, and will only take ten years to stop because of new drugs and improved understanding of HIV.
That all ten million new cases of TB and AIDS happen in Africa is not surprising from the facts and not because of a sudden epidemic of TB and AIDS.
A decade has passed after the death of William Jennings Bryan, a US congressman from the western part of Ohio.
A few years later, at the same town square, a local doctor gave a lecture to fifty people with AIDS.
The disease continues to be caused by the HIV virus with the same ten million cases expected.
AIDS is not rare, but if the rate of transmission between HIV-positive and HIV-negative people has reached any reasonable level, it is quite possible there will be ten million new cases in the next thirty years, the rate of transmission of TB will be increased ten fold from today; and then the AIDS rate will rise ten fold, and finally there will be one million new cases in twenty years.
The only thing that keeps the AIDS rate down even to these current percentages of 10 per 1,000 people in the USA would be an explosion of HIV drugs and rapid technological improvements in treatment and prevention, as well as increased HIV-proof shelter, education, shelter providers.

385,GPT-2 Summary,"Tyradone, known for its heart attack preventing properties, is now showing that it really can help reduce heart attacks.
This new development is particularly important because the vast majority of people are already using heart rate monitors to monitor their pulse and monitor blood pressure so that they can do blood tests to check how the system's functioning are.
If the heart rate monitors are using some form of heart rates of higher than 130%, some people may be developing elevated blood pressure/hypertension.
This is especially true if you take certain medications for your health condition that are also lowering blood pressure.
Tyradone is very good at treating this disease, but due to its unique metabolism, is unable to completely protect against heart attacks.
There are still lots of drugs on the market that can reduce cardiac problems, but they are very expensive.
While people may think heart attack prevention is a very specific disease to improve, one of the major problems that people have with TLDD is that many people with heart disorders still suffer heart attacks due to chronic illness.

386,GPT-2 Summary,"A high-performance data-science platform with distributed database (TL;DR) is being developed by the academic community for the purpose of data mining and data visualization.
In this article, we evaluate the development and use of a simple data structure, Brassica napus, with the goal to provide tools for efficiently and quickly create high-contrast images and data in a manner that enables analysis of large data sets.
The goal of the article is to describe the development and use of an open dataset using Brassica napus, as well as its design process.
Design
The initial prototype of the article is already available online and we invite readers to contribute to improve the code for the next version of the article.
A complete repository has also been made available.
Brassica napus is a low-resolution bacterial growth marker (1 kb) that is sequenced from an incomplete and fragile trassembleable DNA, with an estimated size of 3 kb.
This DNA sequence is the original trassembleable DNA sequence from Brassica napus, which was obtained from The American Laboratory for Microbial Research (ALMIR).
Trait and Genetic Data
The data sets currently available for Brassica napus, including all gene sequence records available from TMBRM, will be available for the study of this article as an open dataset.

387,GPT-2 Summary,"Misc.
The reason some publications may not reach this level of depth is we require multiple translational biologists to investigate hundreds more exons by sequencing many more genes per cycle.
With only a minimal level of depth, more articles may only result in more depth.
This could mean some articles may not be able to cover this level of depth.
In addition, using multiple investigators from the same institution as each investigator can require up to 20 times the resources as doing so with five or one may be necessary (not necessary by design).
(This is a list of all the research articles that I am aware of.
We still need to discuss specific articles when a specific topic arises in research.)
In the words of Stephen Jay Gould, "" If you want to know the real thing it's one or two more hours...""
There's no consensus in my view.
Most exons look the same, so their presence is an artefact of sequencing.
Some exon sites are very different with high similarity of a few exons (e.g.
GTS-928), and even though they are found sequentially they are found sequentially in separate exon groups.
The same thing holds for non-coding sequence information such as exon 3 and 3′ of chromosome 1.
There may be a certain amount of overlap (as gene function is shared in many exons), but I am not aware of definitive evidence to suggest how many exons in the human genome are different and their sequence homology is different from each other.
That said, I do think this evidence must be substantial (if it exists).
We need to consider this when studying exon phylogeny in addition to sequenced exons.
If a sequence homology is not supported by the amount or the frequency of data"

388,GPT-2 Summary,"To understand how the relationship between the immune system and the cornea plays out here's our basic rundown on what the cornea does before it tears.
First Corneal tears come from a series of inflammatory processes that are common in inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis, eczema, and inflammation of other tissues where microvasculature causes severe damage to vascularity.
When a new injury is presented the immune system attacks these damage sites, targeting the keratinocyte (e.g., keratinocytes of hair follicles or skin), macrophages (e.g., macrophages of macrophages), T cells (e.g., T cells of glial cells in the skin), and finally corneal collagen fiber (e.g.
collagen fibers of blood vessels).
(1) In some corneas when the tissue is injured with damage to vascularity they also produce a number of inflammatory mediators as well as a number of endothelium-derived chemotherapies such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), TNF-α, and IL-10, among others.
For corneal tears they are also exposed to other inflammatory mediators produced in the skin, mainly prostaglandins, which play a role in the formation of collagen fibers.
As with all other types of inflammation, corneal inflammation is caused not by a specific trigger, but instead by an array of factors that go together to create a cascade of damage.
(2) Like every tissue, the cornea is very susceptible to overuse, excessive tearing, and over damage.
The cornea is particularly susceptible to"

Our Final Recommendations

As many of you may know, the FDA is studying a number of cosmetic products with potential toxicity that are being marketed for children to address concerns about possible health hazards for children.
This includes many toothpaste products and, especially, products that would help the teeth grow in a more permanent way.
The FDA requires that all new product ingredients be tested on animals as part of their approval process.
In order to meet the FDA's requirements, new product ingredients must use ""natural"" or ""insensible"" materials.
Insensible materials contain the same substance as something, and not a compound such as carbon or sulfur, which can react readily with human health.
Insensible materials are not listed as hazardous by the FDA (although some may still be considered as such), but the company has to get approval from the FDA to advertise any new ingredient being advertised.
While many products are labeled as being non-insensible, many companies actually use such labels to avoid consumer oversight.
Some ""insensible"" materials are more flexible than others.
Non-insensible materials are often used in formulations (such as gel shells or toothpastes of some manufacturers), that are not supposed to be applied directly to the teeth (such as dental fillings).
There are two main considerations we'll discuss here.
First, for certain materials, such as acids, the amount of free"

392,GPT-2 Summary,"Theoretical and biological factors cause elevated plasma levels of circulating IGF-1 to be elevated and therefore to increase clinical risks including the metabolic dysfunction caused by an excess endogenous insulin and diabetes.
In a study in humans, dosing recommendations based on the dpi model were suggested by a population dosing group, based on the ces variant, and based on plasma exposure of glucose, rather than the absolute dose as some currently recommend.
The two earlier studies conducted by helsinki researchers found that when dpi was used as the basis for prescribing diabetes medicine, individuals receiving treatment for common or established forms of diabetes might be likely to receive lower dpi values because of reduced ability to predict plasma insulin levels, thus resulting in reduced plasma glucose levels.
These findings suggested that it might be useful to use ces variation to guide diabetics in their dpi calculation according to changes in glucose concentrations rather than absolute plasma glucose."

I would recommend all interested as well as students of all fields to take a comprehensive look at, read, and explore the information contained within the book.
I had originally tried to write an essay in response to this article, but there was a general lack of support for students of all fields in terms of research on this topic.
It is worth noting that there are a number of articles on the topic.
As stated in the second paragraph above, one of a number of academic studies on this topic has recently concluded it's a well-known issue.
That said, I am always impressed by scientists who study and write about educational topics, so that's why I wrote this piece.
Here goes.
One of the problems that I see with the debate about teacher evaluation of learning outcomes is the tendency by some to focus so much on what can't be quantified.
So when teaching and learning happens, there needs to be a careful distinction between what teachers ""learn"" that is measurable and what teachers merely observe.
I am grateful to have read something by Stephen J. Tett, author of The Power of Teaching.
He wrote:
This concept of teacher testing that we discuss above is a valuable insight into how an evaluation system gets the information it needs to know and how people respond to the information it collects.
But there are two questions about teacher ratings and results, and they come from different sides of the debate: One: Does one believe that teachers do any better or worse than others based purely on their measured performance?
A different response: Are teachers better or worse due to different outcomes measured?
(What kind of a difference?)
Two: To what extent should educators be allowed to attribute different outcome data to teachers and when?
While the first question is probably best settled, the second question is worth"

394,GPT-2 Summary,"--The present paper, which is an attempt at defining the roles and prevalence of enterococcus spp isolations due to invasive surgery in neonates with invasive spp spp infection, using the approach of a 'best evidence' meta-analysis will help identify and address many of these issues.
The research identified 6 cases of non-cardiac (i.e.
soft tissue, genital) enterococcal infections caused by intraluminal spp enterococci which occurred in newborns and post delivery (6-10 weeks of age) during a 2 week period.
The infections were not of hospital infection.
For each patient the total number of patients was estimated at 30.
The overall incidence of this bacterial group was estimated to be 1/1000 newborns.
--The study is not a systematic review of the literature and hence is limited to reviewing articles with an overall or specific goal to identify clinical and pathogenetic mechanisms which account for infection.
In conclusion: Although it is widely believed, empirically, that surgical groups of intraluminal spp are more likely to have pathogenic spp than are groups of intraluminal spp who are not surgery-induced enterococci, there is no direct evidence supporting this assumption.
The analysis identified cases of intraluminal spp enterococci resulting in hospital infections at hospital discharge of infants and post-pregnancy.
This case may partly reflect post-pregnancy intraluminal infection of neonates, however data for this may need to be conducted prospectively in order to more precisely determine if it relates directly to neonatal surgical groups.
The results and discussion in this paper suggest that as the incidence of invasive"

395,GPT-2 Summary,"""Dementia is much more common in the general population than in patients who have dementia "" said Dr. Richard Wernicke, one of the researchers.
He made those remarks in an interview with Dr. Nancy Brown (PhD), President and CEO of the American Association of Alzheimer's Disease and its Early Phase Syndrome (AACEAS).
""Over two and a half million Americans will die of cancer during the first decade, which is about one out of every fifteen adults.
Dementia was found to be 50% more common than Alzheimer's disease and roughly one out of every five women will have a stroke every ten years.
So you have a 60% increase in the risk of developing a stroke in the case of dementia compared to Alzheimer's disease.
In other words, you have a four times increased risk of developing dementia, which means three times the risk of dementia among the general population than is found.
In fact, a recent American Mental Health Association (AMAH) study reported that 40% of Alzheimer's patients had a stroke, as compared to 13% and 14% of people with dementia.
There seems to be another reason why dementia is going so much further up the population ladder at the present time, too: we are all more highly conditioned to fear aging.
A study conducted in Australia confirmed that, when older people were told they would ""be living a much longer, healthier life"" - because if they were not going to see an Alzheimer's phase, they could expect ""a mild decline in memory"" and feel ""much better "" in 5 years' time after the initial stage... the study concluded that ""experience was sufficient to induce rapid memory decline in older people.""

396,GPT-2 Summary,"1) The global incidence of infectious diseases is increasing worldwide due to increased population growth, increasing infectious disease incidence, increasing demand, and increasing burden of diseases caused by an expanding health care system.
2) As global population grows, disease incidence and disease burden increases and is expected to rise because of higher spending on health care.
This increase is particularly strong because of declining world GDP and rapidly increasing population, although population aging continues.
Due to these problems, the global health system is under enormous financial pressure.
3) In response to the growing global burden of disease, many countries implement policies to reduce their prevalence and impact on local communities.
At the same time, many countries also seek to implement policies to eliminate infectious diseases in communities.
4) As governments implement policies intended to reduce burden, the populations they target increase in countries throughout the world.

The syndrome is characterized by the unilateral distribution of multiple visual abnormalities in the dominant orbital region of the face, most notably with an elevated total region of curvature, a prominent perifocal distribution of low level of contrast between primary and secondary structures, and prominent distal peripheral pituitary asymmetry.
The prevalence of the syndrome can vary from 2% to 7% among men.
The syndrome is common, but is uncommon in children and has a higher incidence in the elderly.
The syndrome is classified as hyperpigmentation with excessive acth, hyperpigmentation with prominent pituitary mass, and pituitary disease with low total areas, increased pituitary adenoma, diminished renal function, and perforation in pituitary tissue.
The diagnosis is made using the IHC.
We cannot confirm that this is the first or the only case of hyperpigmentation in the male (although at times we have been asked for confirmatory reports).
SUMMARY:
Sensitivity to visual stimuli increases with age, with the most common syndrome with a prevalence of 2% is called hyperpigmentation with hyperpigmentation.
A second syndrome with similar findings is called severe perforation, with a lower prevalence, but a higher prevalence is hyperpigmentation with enlarged dorsal pituitary and hyperpygonia.

400,GPT-2 Summary,"Chik has evolved from virus that originally causes tropical or tropical colds.
It is extremely unlikely that chik virus exists in the human brain; this could make these infections preventable (i.e.
for severe hemorrhage, and/or chikv infected persons could likely be cured).
chik's current ability to transmit to other people, including our own, requires testing in a number of different countries to determine if chik causes disease.
The primary virus has changed but with its presence or absence have not (although it has become more abundant) with the primary virus having been largely replaced.
Chik is a large virus with a surface area of about 11 micrometer.
It has evolved into other variants and variants over time, including the large subspecies present in the tropical lowland and north west region of Africa.
Treatment is primarily through prophylactic vaccination, where the majority of patients develop chik-related disease (at least a few cases), but some, but not all, develop chik viral disease.
Currently many other tropical lowlands, north west regions of Africa, and even some countries in Asia, are thought to be under chik virus vaccination coverage (1, 2).
However, to date no reports of chik-related cases have been reported.
It is not known if the chik virus is capable of replicating as long as the body does not produce serum antibodies against it.
The human antibody response to chik has demonstrated an approximately 50% correlation.

402,GPT-2 Summary,"1.
Nonlimate ncrnas are the first steps in the synthesis of protein for RNA and DNA and are involved in RNA binding, replication, integration and regulation.
These proteins reside within their native host cells and are primarily recognized as the primary nucleolong-based RNA biosynthetic pathway.
In the ribosome the ncrna system consists of multiple regions where various proteins reside on a DNA base and regulate multiple regulatory pathways.
To understand the ncrana complex one has to realize they are organized in a multilayer system of cells as defined by the ribosome.
By comparing these groups of proteins one can understand how both RNA and DNA are produced and how specific protein domains are required to make different forms.
2.
Two important regions of the ribosome called cofactors are located on the ncrnas side and the cytoplasmic ribosome (CYR) in the central part.
These are responsible for producing ribosomies for the mRNA and translation molecule.
Cofactors are composed of multiple small molecules in different parts of the ncrana complex which collectively modulate ribosome organization.
In cells, this modulating of the ribosome allows ribosomer-independent transcription via different ribosomal complexes (e.g.
bcl-2, caspase-9, tyrosine, ribose) that facilitate translation via the cytoplasmic nucleoside lyase complex.
3.
The NCA provides protein for RNA and DNA synthesis.
The rna proteins, namely the ribosomal proteases catalyze the action of the ribosomal RNA binding and proteolysis reactions.
These proteins are responsible for a large number of ribos"

404,GPT-2 Summary,"Hepatitis B outbreaks have been a problem recently.
However, not many of those outbreaks have been from one country.
There have been a few outbreaks from several countries in recent times.
I propose some key trends around hepatitis B viruses this year.
So, what can we say about this situation?
First off, there's a wide variety of strains of Hepatitis B.
There are a few strains with unique characteristics that makes them easier to detect with the naked eye.
This is interesting as they all pose an opportunity to gain insights into the spread of the strain.
Also, because hepatitis B is so rapidly spreading in North America, it's more likely that this kind of situation will hit the USA.
Some of the countries with the most infections have the most problems but not all.
For example, Colombia has the highest number of cases of hepatitis B (14.5% worldwide), followed by Panama (13.7%), Dominican Republic (12.7), Cuba (11.9), Haiti (9.2), and Bangladesh (8.0).
These countries can spread the infection around a lot due to long standing population or travel patterns.
These countries with the most problems have the fastest increase in the number of cases in recent times.
Some of the countries with the most problems are Haiti, Dominican Republic, Cuba, and Bangladesh.
Here's a chart showing the number of cases of each disease across the globe:
At this scale, where the numbers are very different, it is tempting to interpret what this means as some countries may be doing something unique, while other countries are following the flow of travel patterns (or the rules of travel) more closely.

406,GPT-2 Summary,"If one were to make a point about how far QOL-based care can extend, then the role of QOL-based approaches in the treatment of chronic pancreatitis would include both the following three main facets of approach quality life assessment, the observation and the evaluation of quality-induced change and the understanding of how these change impact quality of life for patients:
(1) Observation : Observation of patient's functioning quality-induced change should be a priority for QOL-based approaches.
The objective of observing is to find out what has changed in the way patients live, work and live around it.
We must not underestimate the importance of observation because not all patients who are diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis will be able to fully cope with all treatments.
This could change their overall quality of life substantially and therefore, could adversely affect quality-induced change.
We must also recognize the potential risk associated with not fully observing and also its importance for quality improvement by providing better support and resources for those patients who are able to adequately observe (or are otherwise able) and for improving quality of life and well-being.
(2) Evaluation : Evaluation can be a challenging task but it can significantly decrease the burden on patients and is integral to the treatment process.
Evaluations provide valuable information which can only be interpreted, not evaluated by the QOL team.
QOL should keep in mind the quality-induced effects on patients living while keeping in mind that it is crucial to understand the nature of the quality-induced effects and the importance of quality as a mechanism to improve patient health as the quality of life can adversely affect quality-induced change.
(3) Clinical interventions : Our goal should be to be able to support the patient's goals with appropriate and appropriate level of interventions.

It is not uncommon for chronic pancreatitis patients to experience"

407,GPT-2 Summary,"All patients presenting benign tumors should avoid any radiation therapy for a period of at least two months.
The following factors influence the risk of breast cancer recurrence for all women.
Proper breast assessment and treatment for malignancy.
The time spent treating and recuperating with anti-cancer drugs can increase the risk of recurrence, because patients may not be fully aware of the risks of radiation treatment.
The following factors influence the outcome of invasive breast cancer recurrence:
Age and body mass index (BMI).
The most predictive recurrence rate is for those with the greatest body mass and age groups.
A higher BMI is often thought to be associated with more aggressive tumors that can be more difficult to treat.
Invasive Breast Cancer Prevalence:  
Estimated incidence: 1 in 100,000.
Breast cancer screening and follow up:  Most breast cancers are diagnosed as cancer by the date of diagnosis and not by follow-up.
However, about 15% of women are diagnosed with invasive breast cancer (more than 10 years after the first breast biopsy).
Clinical and radiologic progression:  If the mammogram suggests malignancy, it is important to refer for the diagnosis of advanced or progressive breast cancer to avoid further unnecessary treatment."

It's really annoying to hear all of the sudden your body feels like a piece of plastic was ripped off like a piece of plastic is being torn from its own body, even if very close to it you can hear that small pressure noise and then you're getting your heart crushed.
The damage is more complicated, but there's still this potential for damage to your heart because the material you're using to form the force is extremely hard.
The reason they're having problems is that their materials are relatively unstable, with very slight variation in their electrical properties and their resistance to mechanical stress due to the way they are processed in the body.
Thermal noise is the first type of disturbance to my body that causes pain, and you can feel the difference between a small stress, which is subtle, like tiny electrical sparks that go right across my nerve chords, and a big and sudden shock - like a large power failure, like a huge electrical discharge from all the electronics you've just bought.
This is where I come in by having a very strong electrical field that gives me a little more leverage to deal with this, although I don't feel the full effect of this.
It's not something I'll be able to describe with words.
In my practice I've found that I can see a very strong vibration that's coming from my left ventricle.

414,GPT-2 Summary,"1) No evidence that local electrocardiographic changes contribute to the mechanism of action of clonidine.
2) There are differences when considering its action in cardiogenic heart disease.
What is the main mechanism by which clonidine exerts cardiac effects?
What are some of its potential effects in cardiovascular diseases?
1) How Clonidine affects local electrocardiographic and electroanatrial effects – The local electrocardiographic change that contributes to therapeutic effects with clonidine can include either: (a) Local changes in heart rate (HR; heart rate at baseline or during sleep state); (b) An ankylosing spondylitis (AS; AS in the postural orthostasis) (e.g.
bradycardia, dilation of small veins); (c) Elevation of mean pressure (mPa; in cardiac monitors for electrocardiographic monitoring, the M is the increase and P is an increase in left ventricular tachyarrhythmias).
This is known as 'cardiac activity and the autonomic nervous system'.
For this reason, local and regional electrocardiographic changes are described in the literature as 'cardiac activity and local heart rate' with the cardiac stimulation being known as 'anterobionic cardiovascular stimulation'.
2) The cardiac activity and local heart rate in response to clonidine – Clonidine acts as a local antidepressant.
The cardiac activity and local heart rate increases after intramuscular injection and is usually maintained after removal of a local ankylosing spondylitis blocker ( ).

The central nervous system consists of six lobes known as the executive system, the anterior insular system, the ventral premotor cortex and the inferior temporal gyrus.
In order to form the correct internal representations needed to sustain movement, sensory information must be transferred between discrete areas depending upon the brain in question.
The central nervous system produces electrical impulses called neurons and serotonin, the neurotransmitter which causes neurons to fire and synchronize.

4.
The frontal lobes include the basal ganglia, insula, amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus.
[3] The frontal lobes contain four thalamus structures, four regions and five subregions, as well as 5 parahippocampal interneurones (p-AICs).
[4] The frontal zones are primarily linked to the brain stem, which sends input to the limbic system, and which determines a person's ability (and thus the capacity) for performing everyday activities.

What makes them different from other conditions is they are more prevalent in adolescence and in young adults.
Anecdotally, I've noticed that patients with a larger and/or more elongated prostate tend to have more frequent urination and this leads to more frequent bladder obstruction.
Since it's not uncommon for patients to have some type of kidney damage, I believe it's possible to treat them with ultrasound to detect abnormalities when these aren't present.
For many people, an ultrasound scan of their right prostate will result in an ultrasound of the bladder, which is an indication for prostate removal.

I should also mention that my research paper, as well as being published in PeerJ, has received a number of peer reviewed publications from high profile scientific research institutions as well.
A lot of research is conducted on animals and humans and it is hard to pin point exactly which organisms influence human health.
From research I've done on mice and rats, it can be seen that their diet correlates to a variety of health effects, but they do not necessarily respond to certain pathogens causing illness.
I've also worked on many projects that examine how the effects of dietary supplements differ based on the body of work conducted.
Of course, research studies and scientific literature change as new technologies are created and researchers are exposed to new sources of information.
Since I have been thinking about this topic with the goal of improving people's lives (in both health and social environments) and that this research, particularly from the microbial level can be used to improve humanity, I thought I'd share my work here in the hopes that it may help others who may follow in my footsteps.
I don't think anyone should buy or consume whole food just because the source is cheap and available from a convenient store.
For health to be good, the balance of nutrients needed and consumed needs to be balanced along with the needs of the overall body of humans.
When people who are suffering from disease are offered whole foods in hopes of ""improving"" their health, their overall health could well be adversely affected due to the lack of proper balance between nutrient needs and the body's own defense system.
The balance of nutrients would be far less effective than it originally was before."

It was once a difficult disease to diagnose and has now been almost completely eliminated, although the underlying mechanisms continue to fascinate the public, although we can no longer expect the cause to be known immediately.

This review is of an earlier form but aims to shed light on a disease which is virtually unknown and which most likely needs to be addressed to allow it to be eliminated from the community.
1.
Understanding the Metabolic Syndrome
So, the metabolic syndrome is an epidemic in humans, probably affecting more than sixty countries, and perhaps more accurately, it has been an epidemic in almost all regions of the globe.
The symptoms of this are very complex and vary from person to person.
Here, the definition of the metabolic syndrome may require some background knowledge in general genetics, to which additional sections will be made available later in the review.
The metabolic syndrome also includes factors such as obesity, diabetes, inflammation, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes (particularly if elevated BMI).
The common denominators tend to be a combination of these risk factors.
At the core is the elevated fat mass, with increased obesity causing more acute complications due to high intracellular Ca2+ concentration (e.g.
a high glucose load) over time.
Increased circulating concentrations of this Ca2+ potentiates the effects of insulin resistance.
Additionally, increased insulin levels have also been shown to decrease insulin sensitivity; hence, hyperinsulinaemia leading to hypoglycaemia leading to impaired glucose tolerance, leading to the metabolic syndrome.
Thus, excess insulin and/or insulin resistance leads to hyperinsul"

A mild, nonspecific facial malformed rash of superficial malformation, with no specific histological features.
On MRI, the patient showed diffuse lesions in the scalp and left parietal bone, with distinct growth zones, surrounding the uppermost edge of the large volume of skin overlying the soft tissue, and overlying the soft tissue in an extent similar to other newborns at that age.
The patient was referred to a pediatric orthopedic surgeon, who performed a major excision.
This was recommended on a multidisciplinary basis, as there was a possibility of additional large, diffuse lesions that were not responsive to other management modalities and would have contributed to an increasing and increasing incidence of skin growth during the acute phase of the disease, resulting in permanent and severe hypophagia.
A second excision was performed at three–month intervals, which continued for two additional years.
The patient has returned to normal.
An objective and brief history of abnormal facial development has been taken prior to any subsequent treatment, and the patient's normal clinical and radiologic findings were normal.

There are many issues that prevent health care providers (doctors, nurses, etc.)
from using and prescribing antibiotics against the wishes of patients.
They fall in the following categories:[7] The public can obtain information about this issue and can access the guidelines.
The American Society for Nephrology advises physicians to follow the recommendations and to ""inform the patient of the benefits of antibiotics against the symptoms of their ailment by including a statement in the hospital's records.""
The American Society of Clinical Oncology suggests that an antibiotic overdose should only be recommended if necessary (also consult [a], if you want to compare recommendations between specialty oncologies)
1.
Pharmacists should include information about this question in their policies and procedures.
2.
The ""best practices "" guidelines and the ""prophylactic"" guidelines are a list of common, commonly used antibiotic doses and how appropriate they should be for each patient.
Many, but not all, of the recommended amounts are expressed as doses of ""two grams of oral antibiotics plus one gram of sterile saline"".
These guidelines have been discussed by the CDC and have been approved for use in the United States by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
I want this blog post to help people with the following issues in managing this issues, including:

424,GPT-2 Summary,"Students are engaged early, young adults are engaged older adults participate earlier
Teaching: A survey of students in the United States (USA) and Canada has demonstrated that students are interested in learning while they are at school.
Students are most likely to engage if their teacher provides an opportunity to help and educate them, while teachers must do an effective job of encouraging students to apply for and apply for college.
Students who engage with an adult teacher receive some benefit from learning but this benefit is not overwhelming.
While most students can learn with less engagement than they experience while attending school, they are more likely to participate with much engagement, and to learn at higher rates.
In short: students who engage later learn in ways students who do not engage are unlikely to learn in ways that are likely to serve them for the longer term.
In fact, a survey of 200 students showed that participants who did not engage significantly did worse on some of their assessment measures than those who engaged in a meaningful activity that was important to the student.

If done correctly, lead extractions do not damage the lead lead point, causing bleeding and/or lead trauma, but may cause permanent damage.
An initial lead extraction and replacement lead should be avoided except in emergency situations in which a patient has undergone a lead extraction.
The risk for lead poisoning is slight and if a patient has had a lead dose given for over 2 days, or if the lead is ingested in large quantities, the risk is reduced to no greater than about 10%.
Trial evidence shows that lead poisoning by intrathecal drug requires repeated monitoring during the first 10 days of recovery.

If your upper teeth are too low, they're not moving as they should.
The solution?
Relax a bit and rotate them back.
The toothpaste may look different but with our post extraction technique, we can lower your teeth with no harm to your teeth.
For instance, you might choose to relax your jaw for ten to fifteen seconds and the force created by the teeth will be more than enough to move your lower premolar.
What is the relationship between age and mandibular angle fracture in children and adults?
A study about 25 families found that younger children had an increased likelihood of developing mandibular angle fracture.
A new study about 18 families found a similar phenomenon after two to four years of age.
What is the relationship between age and tooth extraction and a recurrence of tooth loss?
The prevalence of tooth extraction in the general population has increased dramatically over the last few years.
However, after this process, the likelihood of having a recurrence is quite high.
How is tooth extraction different in the upper dentitions like the maxilla?
Can the child get a better quality of mouth as it is done?
It is really a matter of preference.
This is because of the dental practice of the dentist.
For those who do not want dental work, another option is obtaining an appliance for more traditional oral services.
There are a lot of different appliances out there.

Lipid metabolism plays an important role in cellular function, energy processing and body control of lipid transport to and from adipose cells.
The rate of fatty acid and lipooxygenation is modulated by metabolic activity.
Lipooxygenation by fatty acids (FAA) is initiated at specific times in adipocytes (mesolimbic area), and further increases at lower temperatures, especially during aging.
When these processes are initiated by FA, a variety of processes occur; however, lipid synthesis (L)-3,23-dihydroxy-6-diisopropynylhydrazyl-isoquinoline-5-kinase, 23N-DIP-5N-O-DIP-3-O-methyl-4-homostylpropanoate, 23N-DIP-5N-O-DIP-3-O-amino-2-propanone-1-yl is secreted, and ultimately phosphorylated by LAMP kinase to propanolol (L)-23, dehydroxypropynylisoquinoline-5-kinase, 23I-DIP-5N-OOH-3, 23N-DIP-5N-OOH-2.

430,GPT-2 Summary,"I wanted to explain this, and I think this is very well worth understanding by anyone interested in understanding how treatments are affected by the world's cancer data.
What makes this so important is not necessarily the data themselves.
What I am interested in is that if you have a few of the same basic research questions, can you get better understanding of how disease progression and effects are being affected by the data and how treatments will change and improve?
If you can find or create some variation in treatment between groups and that doesn't give you more options, I strongly encourage you to do so.
It is one thing to apply a standardised strategy from some other source and have it work, it is something else to apply a stratified method to this data and have it apply as well and still get better.
If you are able to apply stratification, I find it a very difficult task as that is what we do most of the time, although I have seen a number of researchers (with large sample size and high confidence) who have managed to figure that out - you do have the power to apply stratification to data without the data being of high reliability and quality, but at the same time when you are applying stratification there is probably a chance that your results are biased by residual confounding you are probably very limited in the breadth of what you are going to be able to control.
While I see this sort of research as very useful for understanding how data is applied, I think it is also useful for understanding why data, even before any intervention or treatment is taken into account, will produce different effects from one part of the population - particularly after the intervention or treatment.

431,GPT-2 Summary,"SRM systems are often used to map light sources to light sensor regions.
SRMs have been used to detect a wide variety of photovoltaic devices and system parts.
It should be noted that SRM methods can create errors in light intensity signatures that are in an ideal state and must be corrected for.
SRM is a robust tool that is not easy to implement in conventional ways - which is reflected in the limited number of approaches (compared to image acquisition methods used to improve light signature accuracy).
As an important issue, however, is that using SRM is not straightforward and there is little reference to good and bad SRM methods.
SRM-based photometric experiments are frequently implemented using nonlinear methods and the results are very subject to experimental error propagation.
It therefore follows from a variety of techniques that, to obtain good SRM results, a few of the methods must be tuned to produce different results for different sensor locations.
Image and light measurements obtained during image acquisition and image-based photometry In recent decades photometric experiments made use of laser photostatic integration to acquire high resolution light sensors.
However, prior to the advent of modern methods for photometrically enhancing spectroscopy and image acquisition there was little information available about the specific optical properties of the various photomagnifications used.
This post considers a theoretical approach describing the properties of the photomagnations during the image acquisition steps of a laser photostatic integration.
As a direct result of this new perspective on photomagnification, we describe several approaches to increase the sensitivity of photomagnifications during image acquisition processes.
First, we consider a few of the most widely used methods - laser photostatic integration (PLUS) and light absorption photometry ("

439,GPT-2 Summary,"In this study we evaluated survival data of 30 patients with progressive spinal-carcinoma osteosarcomatous nodular malignant melanoma and found some preliminary evidence for prognostic value of survival after surgical resection of cancerous bone fragments and associated surgical resections in postoperative survival prediction.
DISCUSSION
A meta/analyses of published data (5) showed that 20%–25% of the patients with spinal cancer end their lives with no prognosis.17,18 In previous studies (2), our data showed that between 40% and 60.3% of all patients with advanced cancer end their lives with no prognosis.18 Also in the latter study most of the patients had been diagnosed with advanced cancer by at least two different centers.17 Despite these conflicting results, we assessed survival following surgery of 30 postoperative patients with advanced cancer of the cervical spine in order to compare postoperative mortality after spinal surgery.
We compared survival of patients undergoing two surgical approaches for radiotherapy and endoscopy, both commonly used postoperative-preparation tools for diagnosis of advanced cervical cancer.
Our results suggested that mortality after spinal surgery in this study was higher than those obtained following bone- or softball reconstructive procedures.
We suggest the possibility of a novel difference in post-operative survival.
While surgery of these types offers some benefit in treating endoscopy-based postoperative complaints, the patients were not informed of this possible outcome, and we believe it was not intended.
CONCLUSIONS AND ADVICE
Our data confirm the clinical importance of surgical recovery after spinal cancer.
Further studies are required to determine whether the clinical survival of patients after spinal surgery has predictive value or is a consequence of surgical recovery.

440,GPT-2 Summary,"Female skeletal system includes all bones visible (as well as femur), also includes soft tarsal and lumbar vertebrae.
Male bone remains are usually much larger (and therefore not visible in detail), but still easily recognizable.
These larger bones usually are preserved by bone-preserving techniques after their removal from their original contexts in the fossil record (with exception of skull).
Skeletal system sexagesimal means that they display relatively robust features, i.e.
larger bones hold larger muscles, tendons or nerves; therefore are easier to recognize and compare with known sexagesimal characteristics (i.e.
the same sex in different contexts).
Sex determination is based on anatomical features and morphological traits.
Note that these two criteria help with identification, whereas the first three criteria should be applied when deciding on morphology.
Anthropology and Paleontology
Anthropology considers bones to be either male or female.
Sex determination involves comparing sex of bones in various species, each based on the size and shape (or ""bone type"") of the individual bone used, plus the age (in years).
This is a key point of a study.
The primary use of sex determination is determining sex of bones in the fossil record.
If a species may not exhibit certain specific female traits (due to different circumstances), sex determination should be used to determine whether they remain intact in the fossil record (or whether they are reduced, or ""abnormal"").
In all the cases where a study's purpose was to look at the morphology and sex characteristics of bones, an average age is recommended, in order to ensure that both sexes are available for comparison.
An average age should consist of a small sample of all available specimens collected in that species's"

441,GPT-2 Summary,"Local or regional anesthesia offers faster and safer postoperative analgesia than local anesthesia alone, especially at 1 mg local anesthesia alone improves analgesia but may worsen neuropathic pain in some people clonidine ketamine prostazopam local anesthesia alone improves neuropathic pain neuropathic pain, milder than severe neuropathic pain, more severe than severe neuropathic pain reduces pain but requires less anesthesia to achieve better outcome.
Clonidine ketamine may provide quicker and less aggressive anesthesia and therefore, less sedation during acute postoperative neuropathic pain.
An effective combination of clonidine ketamine and prostazopam may provide similar or equal analgesia.
General anesthetics:
General anesthesia provides a more humane and effective analgesia with greater efficacy in lower doses.
It is not as effective as local anesthesia.
General anesthesia appears to be less useful in younger patients because there is less need to develop sedative tolerance.
General anesthesia requires additional equipment and medications.
Epinephrine: Epinephrine (ED), a vasopressin receptor antagonist and is the most widely used opioid analgesic, is given intravenously for epidural analgesia only (VADI).
It must be given under general anesthesia.
In VADI, it may be injected, or administered orally to local anesthesia patients.
However, epinephrine is more effective if given by mouth using the intramuscular route of injection.
ED, like naloxone, has been shown to be well tolerated in neuropathic pain patients under general anesthesia and in certain situations, it may be more efficacious in this case.
However, epinephrine is not effective in a neuropathic pain neuropathic pain, moderate to severe,"

442,GPT-2 Summary,"Alpha oscillations, like beta and gamma oscillations play central roles, but are much more difficult to explain.
They are modulated by local feedback feedback influence of external sources such as input and attention, neural structures in the brain are also important.
The structure of alpha oscillations is complex and cannot be described with simple equations, but are the result of a simple model in which local interactions affect the way various cortical areas respond to external stimuli.

443,GPT-2 Summary,"TALON CUSPS
These dental conditions are characterized by two significant morphological features that are the most common causes of dental abrasion.
1) The primary cavity of the tooth develops a mandibular anterior tooth and the cusp and the incisor are fused.
Talon cusps cannot be fully formed without causing a dentition failure from a fusion of the premolars and tooth surface that makes these processes difficult to regulate and control.
For an inbred animal, their size does not change but the cusps are larger then normal.
Talon cusps are caused by fusion of the premolars, which can lead to a tooth injury of a superior and inferior premolar.
This occurs if the primary tooth cavity fails to fuse the incipient premolar or tooth surface fused to and out of position.
2) The talon cusps cannot be developed correctly since the incipient talon cusps are not fused.
They develop a crooked molar and the tooth is often disfigured.
In dogs, talon cusps are associated with low-power energy and low intelligence in comparison to other groups.
When one tooth goes awry due to a malformation, this causes the second tooth to fail before it even arrives.
The result can be a permanent dentition that will cause the canine to have to compensate for the loss of the one the dog cannot normally use.
The tooth can be removed with dental floss from the affected tooth and the new dental work may or may not interfere with an appearance problems.

445,GPT-2 Summary,"A little known topic is that honeybee venom may cause problems in people with diabetes.
I went back and read the literature and found that many people experience mild symptoms with honeybees sting when exposed in the field, and that honeybees have many of the same problems with diabetes and asthma that people with diabetes have.
It is not always easy to know if the venom is the culprit or not, but after learning more about honeybee venom this question started becoming easier to answer.
At first, I figured that since honeybees are stingless, there won't be venom present in bees in contact with people or anything they could handle, therefore any bee sting will just be caused by bacteria or fungi attacking the bee.
There are many different types of bee stings, but most are the same, so by the time I got involved in this project, not all of them had any effect on me.
Honeybees are stingless, but sometimes an adult bee will sting and create a small amount of venom with a sting reflex.
If the adult bee has venom in it, then it comes in contact with your skin and can cause a reaction.
Although it can cause pain and irritation, if the venom is left in contact with your skin even 2-4% can cause a reaction.
Went back and searched for samples of bees in the bee hive, found 3 from Michigan that had the sting of bees, none had any symptoms or caused any trouble, and none were stung in the laboratory.
I read further and decided I needed to find out what it was that would cause honeybees to produce venom in different ways, so I collected 25 samples of bees that all had 2% or less venom at the sampling time"

Therefore I'll be talking about Saliva for Salivation and what you can do with it.
Saliva contains two major subgroups: 1.
Saliva derived from fresh breath 2.
Saliva derived from saliva produced by humans 3.
Saliva produced by bacteria or from other organisms 4.
Saliva derived from other forms of bacteria or by animals These four groups are not related to each other.
They are considered different categories that can easily be separated by studying the different components.
This is similar to how a dog has five different types of teeth.
If I was to list them: Saliva comes from breath, saliva comes from the mouth and from saliva produced by humans.
These are two different types of mouth bacteria (sealic and dental).
Saliva comes from the human breath.
Saliva comes from anaerobic bacteria.
The mouth also has other bacteria (bacterial and other animal) that produce saliva (like your dog, cat, horses, cows, rats and whales, etc.
It is easy to make the distinction).
It gets produced from the oral cavity which contains the surface area of your mouth which is very small compared to other areas and therefore it has a low pressure compared with other areas when you have bacteria like bacteria in water and dust particles on the surface from the wind, the air in the mouth or from bacteria in your nose or ears.

449,GPT-2 Summary,"
Thin plaques, including thin sheets of mucous membrane, are thought to induce short-term depolarization of the brain, but the majority of sudden death cases have involved the thick white plaques.
These thin plaques can be blocked by several factors, including:

Biopsy of the affected person.
Medical treatment or implantation.
Therapy.
A brain tumor.
Biopsy of the affected person can result in severe damage to both the outer and inner layer of the brain, thus causing permanent impairment.
Brain tumors usually are associated with sudden death, but in the rare example of early brain tumor in someone with thin plaques, brain damage may also develop.
Medical treatment or implantation is an almost always effective treatment to prevent permanent brain damage due to plaques or thin sheets of mucous membranes.
Therapy for mild patients is usually able to reduce a sudden death for many patients with plaques.
A brain tumor is typically associated with persistent symptoms of death that persist for months or years after the initial death.
Patients with thick plaques often are able to function normally.
In most cases, thin plaques and thin sheets of mucous membranes simply do not block the clear channel allowing the inner and outer blood vessels to enter the brain to deliver nutrients.
Patients will rarely experience an entire patient brain loss as it has been observed in 1 in 5 cases of sudden death among this patient type.
The term ""brain disease"" (BD) refers to a combination of plaques, thick sheets or a combination of both"

451,GPT-2 Summary,"1.
In clinical practice, many patients develop a perivascular thromboembolic event, which develops even more gradually and is seen in some older patients.
This association is most likely related to perivascular plaque and underlying vascular disease.
2.
Perivascular plaque develops early in the pathogenesis of both inflammatory bowel diseases and ulcerative colitis, therefore, this factor is an early etiology of this condition.
We now know that perivascular thromboembolic events are in many ways correlated with peripheral vascular disease.
We also know that this association is linked to coronary heart damage and atherosclerosis.
3.
One or more peripheral vascular disease syndromes affect the patients with a relatively high incidence of thrombosis, ulcerative colitis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or possibly both at the same time, which can lead to multiple complications, such as intravascular coagulation and myocarditis.
4.
Intravascular coagulation occurs when endothelial cells in perivascular vessels fail to form clots in arteries.
This occurs spontaneously and may require treatment, including removal of perivascular plaque to treat deep vein thromboembolism and cardiogenic atherosclerosis.
5.
IBD and inflammatory bowel diseases are linked in the current classification of ulcerative colitis, however, these two disease syndromes may differ at the molecular level, which has been the subject of recent epidemiological research.
The molecular mechanisms underlying this difference remain to be elucidated.
The molecular factors underlying this difference remain unknown.

It might be possible to induce lupus with luparin or rheumatoid arthritis using an agent such as lupan oil to reduce serum levels of antibodies to the drug.
The researchers also found pristane could decrease the level of production of serum antibody to lupus antigens.
2.
In humans, pristane can induce autoimmune disease symptoms and the incidence of autoimmune diseases are increasing.
The evidence for an association between autoimmune disease and lupus antigens is strong.
The studies using pristane found lupus antigens found antibodies on an autoantibody level to lupus antigens.
3.
The presence of an autoantibody to lupus antigens may signal that lupus antigens are involved.
4.
Pristane used to target autoantibodies may indicate the mechanism responsible for causing lupus.
Lupus can be treated with antibiotics.
People suffering from lupus antigens should not include pristane in their therapy.

I want to share, once again, my hope and dreams for regenerative medicine with the rest of you.
1.
As previously mentioned, allogeneic stem cell transplants of type 1 to type 2 (CD2T1A), and to control multiple disease types is one of the most promising approaches available for treating type 1 and 2 diabetes.
Allogeneic stem cells can be derived from bone marrow and have many potential uses for patients afflicted with and affected by these two disease types.
There have been numerous applications of allogeneic stem cell transplantation, and currently, there exist nearly forty allogeneic stem cell lines and some hundred allogeneic cell line combinations.
The most promising applications for allogeneic stem cell transplantation have been provided by clinical trials conducted in humans and animals, and, of course, we know the efficacy of transplanted grafts in many individuals, particularly patients with type 2 diabetes (TL: I).
The most promising clinical trials in type 2 diabetes focused on the use of an allogeneic stem cell transplant to effectively treat diabetic peripheral neuropathy, which is a type of pain that most patients will experience at some point in life (CL: D-22/T-01/D-27/T-29/T-41).
Allogeneic stem cell transplantation of type 1 patients are also very promising because of their ability to use upto 25% less body cells that are normally present in the blood, allowing the patient to be in"

Pill to Take:

As someone who has struggled with anorexia since I was 16 this experience didn't seem too bad at first.
I wasn't sure what it was, but didn't bother to look further the night before I took it.
Unfortunately it was also extremely painful, taking it seriously turned the worst of it into just pain, and eventually I ended up vomiting and experiencing nausea.
Once I regained some sleep I went back to take it later that night, after that I'm very confident the experience was a thing of the past, there was actually a slight improvement in my eating, and didn't really feel that I was suffering a major depression anymore.
I also took the same antipsychotics before, it was the first time in years there was no significant recovery I was just having trouble getting and keeping down one's appetite, which didn't really help.
I'm not sure exactly why I took it and it's not really clear whether or not I got a chance to recover or not.
My diagnosis isn't a serious one, because even with that I may well only have had about three months notice, and then would return to therapy for a third or perhaps a fourth time.
After treatment, I was in and out of therapy once and was very sick all the time for the next year or two.
I've been through treatment at some point, but haven't really been able to find a better plan for treatment like in a hospital.

456,GPT-2 Summary,"To date, in nearly all cases, the thermal expansion gap is so large that a single heat pipe cannot cover the gap; the thermal expansion gap is so small that a single heat pipe effectively covers it; the thermal expansion gap will remain larger than the gap for any given surface area (e.g., the thermal expansion gap is about 200 nm, which means that if the gap were 60 nm and the diameter of an area of 4 x 3 cm was 5 μm, then there would be about 20 heatsinks with a thermal expansion gap that would be needed to cover that gap).
This is the primary problem with thermal expansion systems, and it's important for thermal expansion systems to perform so well that the gaps between heatsink surfaces do not increase.
A solution to this problem is to design thermal expansion heat pipes so that their edges are sufficiently thin that the edges of the heat pipes can pass over and cover the gaps of all of the heatsinks on those heatsinks.
This would allow any heatpipe on any surface area on any surface to be physically coupled in an effectively static manner to the edge of the heat pipe that was built so that the edge could directly cover the gaps.
It would also eliminate the edge gap requirement on any heatsink as any heatpipe on any surface would provide some direct contact between this heat pipe and that edge.
It's very useful to note that in my view, thermal expansion gap designs should not focus on building a system of all the heatsinks on the system (e.g., the current solution).
Rather, thermal expansion gap designs should focus on designing an ideal system of all the heat pipes on a system.
Thermal expansion gap design is usually not based on the idea that heat pipes (or other systems) should be very close in diameter and the length of the heat pipe should be"

The tumors were not associated with lymph node scarring but with diffuse lymphatic involvement such as with septicemia, and thus in the case of leukemias most patients went untreated and not followed to metastasis due to the absence of any treatment.
However, many patients with mesothelioma were referred to the surgical resective facility, and most of their tumors were resected or removed.

You will need to implement a more robust mechanism to produce good AMSTLS output on the server, but these options make making amstxtls in a way that is both reliable and usable much simpler.
Note that you should be aware that the behavior of the output depends on how the output is created, either locally (on the client), or when the output is downloaded to the server (on the server.)
In this example, we will assume local output, so you should not have to worry about the behavior.
The Amstxtls output consists of two parts, one for data, and one for non-data elements.
The non-data element is called either 'first' or'second'.
The first element, called 'first'.

459,GPT-2 Summary,"The primary objective of this study was to identify airbag related eye injuries in five U.S. States from 1979 to 2000; the incidence of airbag induced ocular trauma per 5.2 million passengers (MOP) and 1.9 million non-patients in the five States.
Secondary objectives included to predict age dependent prevalence of airbag related injuries, age dependent prevalence of airbag related injuries and risk factors or factors as a mechanism for airbag side effects.
This study examined an airbag and crash causing trauma and evaluated the causes and associated risk factors or factors as a mechanism for these injuries.
The authors identified a number of potential mechanisms for risk factors and airbag related ocular injuries and examined this relationship in order to help predict, at a population level, potential risk factors to reduce these injuries or avoid those injuries.
In the United States, airbag induced ocular trauma (AFOD) incidence is highest in patients under the age of 65 years.
This study suggests that the primary function for airbag airbag is to protect driver and passenger from such injuries and not in effect as a preventative measure."

Hypothyroidism
In the late 60's and 70's a number of researchers at the U.S.S.R. began studying the condition of thyroid and other disorders affecting thyroid action.
Although the findings of their study were not yet public at the time, their work led to the creation of a treatment for most hypothyroid patients.
They discovered that patients suffering with the condition of hypothyroidism naturally used more glucose, which they used in an increased amount from the body, thus increasing their metabolism.
However, because the body normally removes its excess excess glucose from the blood and stores it in fat, and there is no ""recovery"" occurring after glucose returns to the blood, this condition continues to occur.

463,GPT-2 Summary,"• Organic synthesis processes are generally very similar or even identical to natural pathway of reaction.
So, the chemical synthesis cycle can be categorized into two different branches with different processes.
• When organic synthesis is occurring, a large number of enzymes are engaged throughout organic synthesis step.
Organic synthesis enzymes often are involved in synthesis or purification of the reaction product and the reactions catalyzed
• Organic synthesis products usually are highly charged, having a high electronic concentration and a low electronic weight and thus, can be synthesized relatively rapidly.
• Direct organic synthesis requires the involvement of the enzymes employed in the synthesis, but typically also require direct chemical reactions.
• Inorganic synthesis requires a large number of enzymes engaged for the synthesis, although usually only one or two catalytic reactions will occur.
• Organic synthesis may be more specific, requiring further synthesis activities involved in reaction initiation reactions, and organic synthesis processes require more complicated reaction mechanisms to utilize, and can therefore be more difficult to accomplish."

465,GPT-2 Summary,"Cognitive Behaviour Therapy is based on a core set of ideas and methods designed to help us reduce stressful experiences and improve our quality of life, not in relation to individual feelings but as a tool to avoid those feelings themselves.
I am pleased to join with David MacKay of CBTUK and Dr.
Rob Paskins of CQC at University College London to discuss the cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) approach in more depth.
CBT is used by mental health professionals in a variety of settings including prisons, hospitals, the criminal justice system, military families, religious communities, and individuals attempting suicide and their families (for more on this topic, see the article from The Royal College of Psychiatrists about suicide).
Although it does not deal with specific individual feelings, as such it is helpful with some of the concerns facing mental health professionals.
I would like to focus on how CBT can be used as a model to reduce risk within families where a suicidal person is at high risk.
1.
CBT
The core ideas discussed by David MacKay at the 2014 workshop were:
In order to address individual feelings it is important to first identify where anxiety, depression and suicidal feelings are located.
CBT should help us reduce anxiety and stress where appropriate, as long as we are able to understand the underlying cause of the anxiety and we are able to intervene where necessary.
An important point to point out is that depression and suicide are a complex phenomenon which are not easily understood (although most of the time) and even difficult for individuals to identify.
As such it is usually difficult to reduce or eliminate a suicide attempt within a suicide rate ratio context.
The primary solution to this is to provide a supportive environment which can provide relief from the anxiety and depression and facilitate the individual finding what they need to seek help by engaging"

467,GPT-2 Summary,"1.
Diabetic rats require a significantly higher dose of insulin than healthy controls for weight maintenance.
The use of insulin to support weight gain in diabetic rats (4 times more insulin) led to significantly lower blood glucose and elevated HbA1c which would cause weight gain.
2.
Diabetes increases insulin levels in the liver as well as adipose tissue, which results in a more pronounced insulin resistance and an increased risk of weight gain in human health (1).
Diabetic insulin:
1.
Higher insulin to support gain in weight, particularly when ingested in larger doses than human insulin (2).
2.
Diabetic rats require far more insulin to maintain normal weight than control rats.
In contrast to insulin acting as a stabilizer to decrease glucose levels (3).
3.
Higher insulin is associated with decreased weight gains due to increased insulin resistance (4).
4.
There is evidence that increased insulin levels decrease glucose levels in the liver and alter lipid metabolism (5).
Diabetic liver:
1.
Higher insulin (which results in higher levels of β-cells in the liver tissue than normal blood) leads to an increase in hepatic glucose production and an increase in the risk of hepatic steatosis.
2.
High insulin levels create liver steatosis, or hyperglycemia in terms of liver triglyceride levels, which are elevated on the basis of impaired hepatic glucose clearance and insulin resistance (6).
Other findings (a) Diabetic patients gain weight due to reduced insulin levels, which in turn increases the risk of weight gain (b) Increased insulin levels lead to increased hepatic glucose production, which directly"

468,GPT-2 Summary,"So now we know about fungal cellulose.
Why do people worry about fungi' food-storage properties?
First off, we know that fungi don't form carbohydrates by fermentation and, secondly, they store some of their waste without using enzymes.
So what?
That's where the fungus is of a higher order, it's its own food source... A typical fungus cell will have between 15 and 25 different cell types, each type may store a different amount of fungal cellulose, so that's 10 to 11 times the amount that humans actually eat per day!
For the fungi' own benefit.
Also, they don't rely on the fungi to convert their food into protein.
We eat very little of it, a mere fraction of the average food source.
And this is a pretty solid defense mechanism.
While it doesn't tell all, you might have seen all the studies of humans and our bodies.
They're pretty well limited in what they know, so a fungus is of an even lower quality than a typical plant.
But again, this is just the tip of the iceberg.
I'm looking in depth into the research of fungi, and I don't intend to just write some articles.
I want to understand more about the health implications as well as what it means for fungi.
I want to look further, in and out and at other things.

470,GPT-2 Summary,"The results of a case, that is presented here, show that low back pain is a chronic condition, that it can be treated by low back pain pain medication, and that the low back pain medication reduces osteoarthritis.
First, low back pain can lead to osteoarthritis of the knees based upon the findings of previous studies (Petersson and Wijts, 2010; Lips et al., 2010).
The pain and associated disability may be worsened when pain associated nerve stimulation fails to result in a response in patients with osteoarthritis.
LIP:
Lipid metabolism changes: The osteocarpine used for the pain reduction has been shown to decrease both lipid content and the inflammatory markers (i.e.
C-reactive protein, fibronectin, and TNF-alpha) in the knee.
Additionally it is shown to stimulate the production of adenosine triphosphate, an inflammatory marker.
These markers decrease as well.
However, low back pain may be associated with poor lipid absorption and in the long run reduce the severity of clinical features.
There is some preliminary evidence that patients with osteoarthritis are less likely to experience low back pain when treated with a low back pain drug.
The clinical trial results of Low Back Pain Drug with Triptan did not show a greater rate of injury during one month after treatment (Liu, 2011).
Further in vivo studies are needed to determine if the Triptan-based low back pain drug, takasu for the acute treatment of chronic knee osteoarthritis has protective effects on the clinical manifestation of low back pain.
The low back pain drug also works"

1.
Reduce ROS (ROS is dangerous.
It causes cancer of the cells and tissues that can cause damage).
It can be inhibited by antioxidant or proteasome molecules called scavengers.
2.
Increase the flow of oxygen (i.e., decrease free radical formation).
3.
Stimulate axons to grow (which will aid in tissue repair).
4.
Modulate tissue growth (i.e., allow more tissue growth from injured cells to repair).
5.
Stimulate nerve growth and healing (also called neuritogenesis).
6.
Add new nerve growth (that will enhance healing).
7.
Increase the level of healing (increased pain signals).
8.
Modulate regeneration by improving axonal stem cell production.
9.
Decrease ROS production (or inhibit it for any reason).
10.
Reduce free radical production/damage (or improve it).
11.
Increase tissue regeneration (increased axonal stem cell production).
This is important because it gives patients less pain or decreased damage from nerve injury and regeneration.
12.
Induce tissue repair (which may lead to enhanced recovery as axon healing is more powerful than normal.

It was a plan by us to utilize a completely different kind of human infection from that of malaria caused by parasites and thus using the vectors from the wild to attack the bacteria that allow life in our blood and tissues were to kill and kill again.
The end result of our Kickstarter campaign on July 17, 2015 was a vaccine that we believe should provide us a chance to make this happen.
The vaccine would be made from two strains of bacterium called Clostridium perfringens and was expected to be available for public use as soon as we received the required financial funding from our partners within the US.
With the help of our partners for the funding we were able to raise the funds to manufacture several thousand doses of the vaccine as well as an online website to share our findings and the results of further testing carried out by partners around the world and many of whom have volunteered their time via our survey and outreach to gather more information and experience to further refine the vaccine.

477,GPT-2 Summary,"- Male sterility can vary greatly and may vary in frequency depending on environmental requirements
- The male meiotic life cycle has been shown to be very variable from species to species.
The mitotic division of female gametophytes plays an essential role in female progeny production.
The sperm of male gametophytes are not produced in a fully developed stage, but remain in the meiotic sacs for two weeks after fertilization.
A progeny that is sexually mature in an isolated environment will eventually die from senescence or will have one or more male somatic cells.
- The male gametophyte is surrounded by a meiotic sac for at least 50 days following the fertilization.
There are two major events occuring at the end of this time.
The end of the meiotic sac.
In this sac, the male gametophyte begins a meiotic process that promotes the establishment of many immature cells.
In the process, the male gametophyte is exposed to the toxic environment, and its meiotic sac will be ruptured to produce a sperm cell.
The mitotic division of the sperm cell that forms the nucleus of the female gametophyte terminates, and this mitotic process produces myopia or brown hair follicles in the female animal.
The male reproductive organ does not grow, and in certain species of azoospermia such as malaria, the male's development has been suspended.
Most of this process occurs within a few days of fertilization, and is not dependent on environmental conditions.

478,GPT-2 Summary,"I wanted to share a few thoughts and insights on what it takes to become the best person on Earth.
As I mentioned in my introduction, the human body has the capacity to be enormous which puts even the most experienced lifter to be near superhuman.
This could be measured in ways a physical examination would fail to, but as I've mentioned before: the more I look into things, the more I like the fact that I am getting better.
I have noticed that people who are a lot closer to being human than they should be tend to be in the ""problems area.""
For example:
1) Those who have long muscle mass – they are missing the muscle clusters they might expect.
2) Those with extreme muscular hypertrophy – often there is a greater demand on muscle structure due to the huge weight lifting that has happened – these are those who have done everything right and yet their muscles feel weak and spasms.
This manifests itself as some sort of joint fatigue/muscle rigidity.
Some people may even say their muscles seem as though they are broken in half – something that is likely to happen due to a deficiency of growth factors.
What is more common is that people do not know when they are doing everything right, or do not really know how to compensate.
They cannot afford to be careful and they lose their nerve cells/tumors/receptors, or other muscle tissue that is the most needed, and so forth.
My advice is that if you have good muscle mass, try to focus on it more carefully to ensure you stay on your toes rather than to have the correct muscle balance.

We have the necessary data on type 2 diabetics, chronic glucose intolerance type 2 diabetes and related metabolic syndrome, obesity and risk factors of complications of CVD.
2.
With a more complete understanding of risk factors of these diseases you can predict the risk of type 2 diabetic and non diabetes events based on the above metabolic risk factors.
3.
In combination type 2 diabetics and diabetes can be a very poor risk factor in the future.
TL;DR:
 A growing body of evidence shows that atherosclerosis is an inherent part of metabolic syndrome due to it's role in reducing insulin and other catecholamines and lowering resting blood glucose levels.
Insulin resistance and obesity are common among people whose body mass is under stress due to a number of factors including weight, waist circumference, genetic predisposition, or diet.
In individuals prone to these disorders, the insulin resistance and insulin resistance related diseases (Iris, Type 2 diabetes) are linked.
The insulin resistance related diabetes is particularly in type 2 diabetic subjects who suffer from the metabolic syndrome and have increased risk for cardiovascular disease.
I think, that this section of the article explains most of the reader's confusion regarding the relationship between insulin resistance and dysregulated adiposity on the one hand and leptin levels and the diabetes related insulin resistance on the other.
I believe that as I've stated earlier, our view of insulin resistance remains vague and difficult to explain in the light of data.
That is also reason for further research and research related to the cause and treatment of insulin resistance and related metabolic diseases.
However, this section of the article shows what we've discovered in the past few years and I hope it will be a helpful resource for everyone interested in studying and treating this complex disorder"

480,GPT-2 Summary,"
Fluorides, especially dental fluorides have come to be the biggest health concern since the first mercury dental amalgam in America in the 1960s.
It is estimated that 70 percent of the U.S. population are affected by a risk factor that leads to dental fluorosis.
There have only been very limited trials in humans on the use of fluoride for tooth protection against dental fluorosis thus far available toothpastes with fluoride levels up to 20% have been shown to be ineffective in preventing tooth decay but could reduce plaque formation associated with fluorosis (Volkmann, 2012).
In the early 21st Century many governments around the world have introduced measures to lower dental fluoride levels which had not been introduced by governments in developed countries until 1970 (WHO 2014).
As a result, the incidence of low levels of fluoride in the oral cavity due to a compromised diet or lifestyle levels are increasing.
The average fluoride levels in the United States have risen from 1.34% in 1990 to 1.72% in 2013 (WHO/Grull, 2014; CDC, 2013) which is 3-6 times the current average (WHO, 2013).
Recent epidemiological studies indicate that tooth enamel is affected significantly by dental fluorosis, which can lead to the development of tooth decay when fluoride levels drop below a certain level.
A study conducted in Mexico and published in the scientific journal Dental Research in 2014 indicated that over one out of ten adults in the U.S. is at risk, although in Mexico the numbers are even higher.
The studies were conducted in eight Mexican communities by the Universidad de Las Cabanas de México (UNMI) and"

481,GPT-2 Summary,"· It is now not uncommon or widespread to refer to breast cancer as a cancer within a malignant stage (prospective breast cancer) but there has been little attention to other causes of death (prospective, primary, and distant metastatic or neoplastic cancers) among women in all of their lifetime.
There is no single risk factor that predicts fatal breast cancer and those factors depend on many overlapping characteristics.

482,GPT-2 Summary,"All things being equal, higher electric charges facilitate more rapid chemical reactions; therefore higher electric fields can significantly enhance chemical reactions in most cases, despite its inherent disadvantages.
If more and stronger electrons are available, electrons can be moved in particular directions without moving electrons through a magnetic field.
The same can happen to larger charged areas, since larger charges carry stronger magnetic fields, and so can move away from those areas if they aren't being attracted to those area.
So how many times have you seen something or an electron go ""up"" instead of ""down""?
These observations tend to suggest that, by being very concentrated there are generally weaker interactions of electrons, a result in which the electrons move closer together at a faster rate than they do in very dense areas, and with better energetic efficiency.
But in that case you could conceivably use higher voltage to charge the reaction to provide more energetic efficiency, and thus an increase in the rate of reaction.
That could work, but a few thousand times to build energy or chemical reactions just wouldn't have been worth it in a practical setting.
The important question to answer, if your electric field determines how fast charges can move and what areas are affected by electrical charges is, ""What happens to charged plasma when the field is reduced in a linear fashion, e.g.
when the magnetic field is removed?"".
So what's the answer?
It turns out a few things.
First, if electric currents are applied to charge clusters, then higher potential energy and an increase in the voltage of the clusters will reduce the electric field, as it did for large-scale molecular events.
But that doesn't mean the electric field can disappear completely.
Instead, it can be modified along the charge direction itself, with an increasing number of points near the top and bottom of the cells."

485,GPT-2 Summary,"Vitamin levels are lower than recommended by experts.
We may have some role in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus because high blood levels of vitamin D may lead to increased oxidative stress, which is seen in many modern diseases.
To counteract these effects, we recommend that Americans consume more vitamin D.
Background There is no consensus among doctors and nutrition professionals as to the degree of vitamin D deficiency in the United States.
There are several estimates of the prevalence of diabetes mellitus using multiple sources of evidence.
In 2011, the American Joint Committee on Nutrition estimated that 18% of American adults are overweight or obese; 21% are severely stunted; 18% are undernourished; and 5% are undernourished-infant formula fed and 25% of men and 6% of women.
The American Public Health Service (APHS) reports that the total mortality rate for non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NAFLD) was 13.4 deaths per 100 000 population in 2004.
Because of large heterogeneity in mortality rates across countries and even within countries, the actual figure may be higher.
Since 2010 the APHW has revised their estimation and the new estimates are 3 times lower.
Furthermore, there are no national/international guidelines defining the exact amount of vitamin D individuals should be consuming.
Despite these limitations, there is consensus that at least 1000 IU/day, ideally over the summer period as part of the recommended daily allowance (RDA) of 250-500 IU (1,000-1,500 mcg/day), is still recommended for adult healthy adults, including infants, children, pregnant women and adults in nursing homes.
The number of people who are vitamin D deficiency or insufficient is unknown, but the total number of adults in the US, even from the highest risk population is estimated to"

It is important to recognize that we need to continue our review of all options including Rfviia, to make informed and responsible decisions regarding which of the aforementioned options to pursue.
This review is not the perfect representation of a treatment's efficacy or risks, and the decision whether to pursue a treatment's benefit or risk should be informed by as informed a study design and as careful and thorough an analysis as possible.
A well rounded assessment of the benefits and risks of each treatment and method are, it seems, necessary to determine which, if any, treatment meets our current clinical need for patients with cardiac trauma.
This review is for purposes of helping patients identify alternatives that appear to provide the best benefit, with the least potential for harm.
It is also for purposes of recommending which option may be more of a good idea or less of a good idea depending on the risk of treatment failure.
This is not to say that such assessments are worthless, nor do they necessarily dictate patients' best course of action.
The issue is that these assessments don't fully account for different risks: risks inherent in medical science, such as disease, trauma, infectious diseases...etc., that may differ between methods.
Additionally the findings that may make patients interested in a particular treatment may be completely different from what a study would lead to or what data may be available on.
To avoid the risk of repeating ourselves, I encourage you to search for and review the following sections of this review that discuss the potential benefits and risks of each treatment and method.

This results in fatigue, muscle weakness, gastrointestinal and CNS signs and symptoms, rapid weight loss, weight gain, poor appetite, poor mental alertness and anxiety symptoms.
Many of these signs and symptoms eventually progress to chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and/or severe mental symptoms, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that leads to homelessness and suicidal ideation.
As previously mentioned Epidemic immune reactions are now classified into two subgroups: Antiretroviral (ARV) responses like hepatitis B virus (HBV) and AIDS and those that are a result of environmental factors that often do not produce ARV responses.
In the latter group we talk about the so called ""neoadjuvant"" immune system (NEAT).

Epidemiology of FAD is not a simple statistic to report, it is not a simple graph either!

I want to clarify my stance on whether or not TLC can be good for you, because there is a risk to everything including your own health.
I do what I can to avoid using it, but it is not my intention to shame anyone who does not want TLC and the reasons for using it are well researched.
I feel that it's ok to use TLC depending on the risks of its use if you can manage them.
There are a slew of side effects that may cause you to discontinue use in an attempt to prevent the side effects, but for an occasional user that's ok as long as they're careful and don't suffer any side effects.

Ehrh makes it so that the erythroid cells don't release enough erythroid related end products at the time erythropoiesis occurs.

We first noted some preliminary results in our laboratory which demonstrated that tumor cell lines containing lymphoma cells contained significant amounts of Annexin, but at this time, there have been no experiments in humans.
The two most common applications for bfcs are as an antiangiogenic therapy, which is found in cancers of the intestine, and in diagnostic tools, such as X-rays to remove tissue from tumours.
A new study is taking place which uses bfcs to provide evidence of antiangiogenic activity in intestinal cancer cell cells.
In this study, co-workers at Imperial College London used the bfcs annexin to image intestinal cancer cells in vitro and found that it could detect the presence of highly mobile lymphocytic tumors.
The authors have published in PLOS Pathogens ( 2014 ).
Since this is the first study reported to demonstrate that bfcs may have antiangiogenic activity in cancer tissue cells, it will not do to argue about exactly which studies (if any) it will result in.
There is however still an opportunity to provide further testing with this annexin.
Although it is not a commonly tested component of a new study, it does seem that if a high number of tumor cells were used, this may be the case.

494,GPT-2 Summary,"1) No evidence from the available clinical and pediatricians data supports the hypothesis that the risk of death from cancer is significantly higher among black college-educated women.
2) No scientific case exists that supports the existence of a relationship that has the potential to exacerbate a large number of preexisting clinical comorbidities among black women.
3) The risk reduction provided by the presence of breast cancer screening does not offset the substantial increase in the risk of death from breast cancer between 1991 and 1998."

495,GPT-2 Summary,"*This article was generated from a post that was published on September 10, 2014.
**Sarcoma is generally classified as ""very common"" and is the most ""prevalent"" childhood cancer.
The primary aim of this blog entry was to describe my understanding of why Sarcoma forms in childhood.
Other than that, I tried to describe as accurately as possible the clinical and physiological history of my patient.
In particular, I did not use the clinical descriptions provided by the surgeons because some of them appear to be out of date and are inadequate for treating my child with this rare neuropathology.
However, I will share with you the information that I have gathered through the years, that will help to identify an aggressive tumor and, most of all, prevent an unnecessary operation to remove it.
When we look at sarcoma as cancer the primary focus should be on what it is doing to the brain.
The clinical presentation of Sarcoma in children of any age is always a ""case"".
It is typically the case of the patient having a ""tumour"" which causes significant injury to the tissues in the area of the brain that is involved in sensory processing but also produces feelings of pain.
When the brain injury causes signs or symptoms that are inconsistent with something else happening in the brain we will call it an ""interactive tumor.""
Sarcomatism, sometimes called sarcoma, may be the most common of the tumors.
The term ""tumor"" is used because we do not believe that there is some underlying physiological cause"

496,GPT-2 Summary,"Cisplatin is very much like the most powerful drug there is, it damages, inhibits, and destroys.
One new drug is currently in development, an analogue of cisplatin or cisplatin analogues.
The problem with cisplatin is it damages cells, so it is most effective at removing cancers and preventing them from growing, the same idea is true for dna.
Cisplatin prevents cell viability, preventing cancer cells from progressing, the exact opposite.
Also, no other drug is able to remove all of a cancer by itself, so it must act as an antagonist to prevent the entire cell to progress, in other words the same as a weak molecule such as chemotherapy.
Another issue with cisplatin is it is highly effective at preventing cancer growth, so many types of cancers will grow after only a few weeks of use, this also causes additional side effects including toxic effects such as necrosis/scarring.
Another new drug also approved to treat some cancers is colorectal cancer, it has recently been discovered that it also inhibits cytochrome P450 and cytochrome c in cancer growth.
This is also true of the anti-tumour effect of cisplatin, it also prevents necrosis and scarring of prostate cells.
This causes some of the side effects discussed earlier.
In addition, while a new drug seems promising, one problem is the risk of side effects, one of the new drugs only seems to have short-term and very limited efficacy.
Overall cisplatin is much more like an anti-cancer drug than an anti-cancer drug.
I'd personally buy this new drug over"

499,GPT-2 Summary,"Most of mankind's progress since the beginning of recorded human existence occurred between 20,000 BC and 40,000 AD.
And in all of history humans have had very little genetic diversity, high infant mortality and a relatively small per child income increase.
The average infant mortality rate peaked when modern humans experienced modern epidemics like Little Ice Age and Black Death.
The global human population grew between 10 and 21 billion between 50,000 BCE and 500 CE.
At the other end of the world this population decline accelerated and eventually peaked around 12,000 CE or 1000 years before the present day and was still increasing by 800 G I B.
Answers to common questions on population growth.
The most frequent questions asked by biologists today are:
""What causes population growth?""
""How big is the human population now?""
""How big is the next wave of population growth?""
The basic answer is:
""A very high amount!"".
It is the world's most common estimate that human populations will increase from 7 billion today to 100 billion by the year 2100.
While there is uncertainty over this number, it is the expected level we need to begin thinking about human population growth.
In a recent paper by Professors Michael Huw, Professors Brian Wojcik and Mike Brown, Professor Joseph Tungi and Professors Scott DeBruine and Robert Rask, there is much more detail of the expected increases for various human populations.
In fact, what is not so well understood is how our ancestors could have accumulated so much energy and been so able to have so many children.
What caused this growth?
There is some historical evidence to demonstrate that human populations grew at slower rates or even stopped increasing at some point in the previous human history.
This is called the ""slowest rate of change"" evidence.
It is one theory that has been strongly supported"
